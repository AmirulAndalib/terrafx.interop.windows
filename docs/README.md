### Goals

Provide interop bindings for the Windows 11 (v10.0.26100.6584) and DirectX Agility (v1.618.2) SDKs

The bindings should be blittable, trim safe, AOT compatible, and as close to 1-to-1 with the underlying C API definitions as feasible. Put simply, they are as close to `#include <Windows.h>` as you can get in .NET

Not all headers are provided by default due to size, new ones are added upon request. Some of the most common headers provided are (this is non-exhaustive):
* DirectX
  * d2d1
  * d3d9
  * d3d10
  * d3d11
  * d3d12
  * d3dx12
  * dcomp
  * dinput
  * dwrite
  * dxgi
  * x3daudio
  * xapo
  * xaudio2
