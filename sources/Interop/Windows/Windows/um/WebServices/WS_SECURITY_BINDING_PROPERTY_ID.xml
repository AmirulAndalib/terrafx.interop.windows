    <summary>
      <para>Identifies the properties used to specify security
binding settings.  Security binding settings are present
in <see cref="security bindings" /> that are used, in turn, in a <see cref="security description" />.</para>
      <para>This enumeration is used within the <see cref="WS_SECURITY_BINDING_PROPERTY" /> structure, which in turn is used in a <see cref="WS_SECURITY_BINDING" /> structure. Not all values are applicable to all security bindings. Please see the individual descriptions for a list of security bindings that support the respective property.</para>
      <para>Note that the related enum <see cref="WS_SECURITY_TOKEN_PROPERTY_ID" /> defines the keys for extracting fields from a security token instance.
Thus, <see cref="WS_SECURITY_BINDING_PROPERTY" /> enables specifying security binding
settings at channel / listener creation time to influence how a
security token is created and used, whereas <b>WS_SECURITY_TOKEN_PROPERTY_ID</b> enables extracting fields out of a security token -- typically a
security token from a received message when the channel and security
are 'live'.</para>

  <member name="WS_SECURITY_BINDING_PROPERTY_ID.WS_SECURITY_BINDING_PROPERTY_REQUIRE_SERVER_AUTH">
    <summary>
      <para>A <b>BOOL</b> that specifies whether server authentication is mandatory.  Currently, this setting
is applicable only when using Windows Integrated Authentication based
security.  Setting this to <b>FALSE</b> is strongly
discouraged since, without server authentication, a malicious party
masquerading as the server cannot be detected.</para>
      <para>The default is <b>TRUE</b> when used with <see cref="WS_TCP_SSPI_TRANSPORT_SECURITY_BINDING" /> and <b>FALSE</b> when used with <see cref="WS_NAMEDPIPE_SSPI_TRANSPORT_SECURITY_BINDING" /></para>
      <para>If a protocol that does not do server authentication (such as NTLM) is
to be allowed, this property must be set to

  <member name="WS_SECURITY_BINDING_PROPERTY_ID.WS_SECURITY_BINDING_PROPERTY_HTTP_HEADER_AUTH_SCHEME">
    <summary>
      <para>A <b>ULONG</b> that specifies the HTTP header authentication mode to use. The value specified must be a combination of one or more of
<see cref="WS_HTTP_HEADER_AUTH_SCHEME_NONE" />, <b>WS_HTTP_HEADER_AUTH_SCHEME_BASIC</b>,
<b>WS_HTTP_HEADER_AUTH_SCHEME_DIGEST</b>, <b>WS_HTTP_HEADER_AUTH_SCHEME_NTLM</b> or
<b>WS_HTTP_HEADER_AUTH_SCHEME_NEGOTIATE</b>. When setting this property on a binding used to communicate
with an HTTP proxy server, only one scheme should be set, and <b>WS_HTTP_HEADER_AUTH_SCHEME_NONE</b></para>
      <para>may not be used.</para>
      <para>Alternatively, this property may be set set to <see cref="WS_HTTP_HEADER_AUTH_SCHEME_PASSPORT" />.
<b>WS_HTTP_HEADER_AUTH_SCHEME_PASSPORT</b> must not be combined with any other value and cannot be used to
authenticate to an HTTP proxy server.</para>
      <para>
        <see cref="WS_HTTP_HEADER_AUTH_SCHEME_NONE" /> is only supported on the client. Setting it by itself disables HTTP header authentication.
Setting it in conjunction with other schemes allows the client to fall back to no header authentication when the server does not require it.
Otherwise, if the client specifies multiple authentication schemes and the server requires no authentication the request will fail.</para>
      <para>When setting a single authentication scheme, the client will perform the request with that scheme set. If multiple schemes are set,
the client will first probe the server for the supported schemes by sending an unauthenticated blank request. Should the client
and server share more than one supported scheme, the client will prioritize schemes in the following order and pick the first mutually
supported one:</para>
