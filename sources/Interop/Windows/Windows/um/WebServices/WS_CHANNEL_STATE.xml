    <remarks>
      <para>The following are the state transitions for a channel.</para>
      <para>.:image type="content" source="./images/ChannelStates.png" border="false" alt-text="Diagram of the state transitions for a Channel object. A second diagram shows the Sub-states for the Channel's Open state.".:</para>
      <para>A channel may move to the <b>WS_CHANNEL_STATE_FAULTED</b></para>
      <para>state even if <see cref="WsAbortChannel" /> was never called.
This will only occur if the channel can no longer be used.</para>
      <para>Note that only the valid state transitions are shown.  Using
a function not shown for a given state will result in an
<b>WS_E_INVALID_OPERATION</b> error being returned from
the function (or crash in the case of <see cref="WsFreeChannel" />).
