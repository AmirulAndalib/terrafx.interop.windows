    <summary>A set of property values associated with the error. They are set and retrieved using <see cref="WsGetErrorProperty" /> and<see cref="WsSetErrorProperty" />.</summary>

  <member name="WS_ERROR_PROPERTY_ID.WS_ERROR_PROPERTY_STRING_COUNT">
    <summary>
      <para>The number of error strings (ULONG) available in the error object. Error strings might be added using <see cref="WsAddErrorString" />. When <see cref="WS_ERROR_PROPERTY_ORIGINAL_ERROR_CODE" /> is present in the error object, the corresponding error text will be counted as an additional string in the returned number of error strings.</para>

    <summary>
      <para>If the error returned from the function was mapped to one of the standard WS_E_* errors, then this property is used to store the original implementation specific error code.</para>
      <para>Note that the original error code is specific to a particular implementation and version of the underlying libraries used by WWSAPI. It should not be expected to remain constant, as the libraries may change.</para>
      <para>The main purpose in exposing this error is for diagnostic purposes, as the application may take a look at original error code of underlying library that caused this error.</para>
      <para>Applications that take specific action based on the implementation specific error code will likely be broken when the implementation changes.</para>
      <para>If the error was not mapped from an implementation specific value to a standard error, then this property will have the value NOERROR.</para>
      <para>The default value is NOERROR.</para>

      <para>This identifies the language of any language sensitive information in the error object.</para>
      <para>This value may not be zero.</para>
      <para>This value may only be set when the error object is first created, or after it has been reset using <see cref="WsResetError" />.</para>
