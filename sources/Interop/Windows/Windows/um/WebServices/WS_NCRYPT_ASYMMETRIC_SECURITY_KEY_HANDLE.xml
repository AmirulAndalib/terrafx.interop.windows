    <summary>
      <para>The type for specifying asymmetric cryptographic keys as a CryptoNG NCRYPT_KEY_HANDLE.</para>
      <para>When this structure is used in an API (such as with<see cref="XML token creation" />) and subsequent<see cref="use of that XML token" /> for a channel), the application is responsible for making sure that the NCRYPT_KEY_HANDLE remains valid as long as the key is in use. The application is also responsible for freeing the handle when it is no longer in use.</para>
      <para>This type is supported only on Windows Vista and later platforms.</para>
