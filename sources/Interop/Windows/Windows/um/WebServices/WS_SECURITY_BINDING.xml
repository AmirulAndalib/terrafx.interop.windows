  <member name="WS_SECURITY_BINDING">
    <summary>
      <para>The abstract base type for all security bindings. One or more concrete subtypes of this are specified in the<see cref="security description" /> that is supplied during channel and listener creation. Each concrete subtype of this corresponds to a security protocol and a way of using it to provide authentication and/or protection to a channel.</para>
      <para>Each security binding subtype instance in the security description contributes one security token at runtime. Thus, the fields of this type can be viewed as specifying a security token, how to obtain it, how to use it for channel security, and how to modify its behavior using the optional settings.</para>
