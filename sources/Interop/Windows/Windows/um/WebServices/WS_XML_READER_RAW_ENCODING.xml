    <summary>
      <para>Used to indicate that the reader should surface the bytes of the document as base64 encoded characters.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>This encoding can be useful when it is desirable to read an arbitrary, perhaps, non-xml document
while still using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/wsw/ws-xml-reader">WS_XML_READER</a> abstraction.  In this encoding, the bytes comprising
the document are presented as base64 encoded characters at the root of a xml document.  In order to
accommodate non-whitespace text at the root of the document, the reader will operate as if the
<see cref="WS_XML_READER_PROPERTY_ALLOW_FRAGMENT" /> property has been specified.</para>
      <para>The bytes of the document are only converted to base64 when necessary.  So, for example, using
<see cref="WsReadBytes" />, which normally performs a base64 decoding of the characters it reads,
actually avoids all base64 conversions and is the most efficient way to read documents in this
encoding. Using <see cref="WsReadChars" />, for example, will cause the bytes to physically get
converted to their corresponding base64 characters.  In general reading the document using
anything other than <b>WsReadBytes</b> will incur the base64 conversion.</para>
