      <para>The binary XML encoding.</para>
      <para>Although the data is still in the XML
infoset format, this encoding typically results in smaller messages
that require less CPU to produce and consume.</para>

      <para>The binary XML session encoding.</para>
      <para>Although the data is still in the XML
infoset format, this encoding typically results in smaller messages
that require less CPU to produce and consume.</para>
      <para>This encoding is like <see cref="WS_ENCODING_XML_BINARY_1" /> but adds the
feature of a session dictionary.  Because this encoding requires a
session, it may only be used on sessionful channel types
(<see cref="WS_CHANNEL_TYPE_DUPLEX_SESSION" />).</para>
      <para>The session dictionary is a data structure maintained by both the
sending and receiving side of a channel.  The session dictionary
is used to optimize the transmission of string data.  The first time
a particular string is written, it is encoded using in the full string
format.  If the same string is written again, then it will use a smaller
tokenized form, which can reduce message size.</para>
      <para>The writer of the string data selects which strings are candidates for
the session dictionary by filling out the dictionary and id fields of
the <see cref="WS_XML_STRING" /> structure.</para>
      <para>The size of the session dictionary is configured using
<see cref="WS_CHANNEL_PROPERTY_MAX_SESSION_DICTIONARY_SIZE" />.</para>
      <para>This encoding requires SOAP 1.2 (<see cref="WS_ENVELOPE_VERSION_SOAP_1_2" />).</para>

    <summary>
      <para>The MTOM encoding.</para>
      <para>The MTOM encoding optimizes for binary data by avoiding the costs
of converting binary data to base64 format.  For messages containing
large amounts of binary data, this encoding usually results in smaller
messages that require less CPU to produce and consume
than with a text encoding.  This encoding is typically not as efficient as
a binary encoding, however.</para>
      <para>The XML part of the MTOM package is written
using <see cref="WS_CHARSET_UTF8" />, but may be in any <b>WS_CHARSET</b> when read.</para>
