  <member name="WS_SECURITY_PROPERTY_ID.WS_SECURITY_PROPERTY_TRANSPORT_PROTECTION_LEVEL">
    <summary>A <see cref="WS_PROTECTION_LEVEL" /> value that determines whether signing alone or signing plus encryption should be done for the connection. With at least one transport security binding in the security description, the default is <b>WS_PROTECTION_LEVEL_SIGN_AND_ENCRYPT</b>.</summary>

  <member name="WS_SECURITY_PROPERTY_ID.WS_SECURITY_PROPERTY_TIMESTAMP_VALIDITY_DURATION">
    <summary>With mixed-mode security, this property is a WS_TIMESPAN structure that specifies the timestamp generated by the sender will remain valid for this duration from the security application instant. This setting is sometimes called 'time-to-live' or 'TTL'. The default is 5 minutes.</summary>

    <summary>With mixed-mode security, this property is a WS_TIMESPAN structure that specifies the maximum skew allowed between the clocks of the sender and receiver. This quantity serves as a margin of tolerance on the enforcement of settings such as <see cref="WS_SECURITY_PROPERTY_MAX_ALLOWED_LATENCY" />.<br />The default is 5 minutes.</summary>
