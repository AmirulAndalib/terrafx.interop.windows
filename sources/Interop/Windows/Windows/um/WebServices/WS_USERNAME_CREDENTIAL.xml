    <summary>
      <para>The abstract base type for all username/password credentials.</para>
      <para>Note that <b>WS_USERNAME_CREDENTIAL</b> and its concrete subtypes are used with the WS-Security <see cref="WS_USERNAME_MESSAGE_SECURITY_BINDING" />.<br />They are best suitable for application-level username/password pairs, such as those used for online customer accounts. The usernames and passwords specified are not interpreted by the security runtime, and are merely carried client-to-server for authentication by the specified server-side username/password validator specified by the application.</para>
      <para>In contrast, the <see cref="WS_WINDOWS_INTEGRATED_AUTH_CREDENTIAL" /> and its concrete subtypes are used for Windows Integrated Authentication and the security bindings that use it.</para>
