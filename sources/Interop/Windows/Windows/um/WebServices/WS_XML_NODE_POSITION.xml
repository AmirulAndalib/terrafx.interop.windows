  <member name="WS_XML_NODE_POSITION">
    <summary>
      <para>Represents a position within an XML buffer. The current position within a reader or writer may be obtained by calling <see cref="WsGetReaderPosition" /> or<see cref="WsGetWriterPosition" />. The current position within a reader or writer may be set by calling <see cref="WsSetReaderPosition" /> or <see cref="WsSetWriterPosition" />.</para>
      <para>Using <see cref="WsRemoveNode" /> to remove a node that corresponds to or contains a position will cause subsequent use of the position to fail. The position itself remains valid, but operations that depend on that position will fail.</para>
      <para>Positions may be used as long as the containing XML buffer is valid. Using a position after its corresponding buffer has been deleted will exhibit undefined behavior.</para>
