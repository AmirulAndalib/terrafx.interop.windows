    <summary>
      <para>Used with <see cref="WsGetHeapProperty" />.  Returns
the total number of bytes that can be allocated from the heap.  The total
number of bytes is defined as sum of the sizes passed in all the calls to
<see cref="WsAlloc" /> since the heap was created / reset.</para>

  <member name="WS_HEAP_PROPERTY_ID.WS_HEAP_PROPERTY_TRIM_SIZE">
    <summary>
      <para>Used with <see cref="WsGetHeapProperty" />.
Returns the maximum number of bytes of memory that the heap will
retain after a call to <see cref="WsResetHeap" /> call.  This should
be treated an approximate value due to heap overhead.  If the
trim size is larger than the max size, then the size of the
heap will not be trimmed.</para>
