    <summary>Each heap property is identified by an ID and has an associated value.</summary>

  <member name="WS_HEAP_PROPERTY_ID.WS_HEAP_PROPERTY_MAX_SIZE">
    <summary>Used with <see cref="WsGetHeapProperty" />. Returns the total number of bytes that can be allocated from the heap. The total number of bytes is defined as sum of the sizes passed in all the calls to<see cref="WsAlloc" /> since the heap was created / reset.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="WS_HEAP_PROPERTY_ID.WS_HEAP_PROPERTY_TRIM_SIZE">
    <summary>Used with <see cref="WsGetHeapProperty" />.<br />Returns the maximum number of bytes of memory that the heap will retain after a call to <see cref="WsResetHeap" /> call. This should be treated an approximate value due to heap overhead. If the trim size is larger than the max size, then the size of the heap will not be trimmed.</summary>

  <member name="WS_HEAP_PROPERTY_ID.WS_HEAP_PROPERTY_REQUESTED_SIZE">
    <summary>Used with <see cref="WsGetHeapProperty" />. Returns the current total number of bytes requested from the heap since the heap was created/reset.</summary>

  <member name="WS_HEAP_PROPERTY_ID.WS_HEAP_PROPERTY_ACTUAL_SIZE">
    <summary>Used with <see cref="WsGetHeapProperty" />. Returns the current total number of bytes that the WS_HEAP has allocated from the operating system for purposes of providing allocations.</summary>
