  <member name="WS_FAULT">
    <summary>A Fault is a value carried in the body of a message which conveys a processing failure. Faults are modeled using the <b>WS_FAULT</b> structure.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="WS_FAULT.code">
    <summary>
      <para>The head of the list of fault codes which identifies the type of fault.</para>
      <para>The fault codes are ordered from most generic to most specific. There must be at least one fault code. The first fault code must correspond to a fault code defined by SOAP. For <see cref="WS_ENVELOPE_VERSION_SOAP_1_1" />, only the most specific fault code is serialized (the first one in the list).</para>
      <para>If the namespace URI of the first fault code is the empty string, then the first fault code will be transformed as follows when the fault is serialized, as follows:</para>
      <list type="bullet">
        <item>
          <description>The appropriate SOAP namespace will be used based on the <see cref="WS_ENVELOPE_VERSION" />.</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>If the local name is "Sender" when using <see cref="WS_ENVELOPE_VERSION_SOAP_1_1" />, then "Client" will be used instead.</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>If the local name is "Receiver" when using <see cref="WS_ENVELOPE_VERSION_SOAP_1_1" />, then "Server" will be used instead.</description>
        </item>
      </list>These transformations allow a SOAP fault code to be specified without having to worry about which SOAP version is used.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="WS_FAULT.reasons">
    <summary>The text describing the fault. This is an array to allow for different languages.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="WS_FAULT.reasonCount">
    <summary>
      <para>The number of reasons in the reasons array. This would be more than one if the text was represented in multiple languages. There must be at least one fault reason.</para>
      <para>For <see cref="WS_ENVELOPE_VERSION_SOAP_1_1" />, only the first reason is serialized.</para>
    </summary>
  </member>
  <member name="WS_FAULT.actor">
    <summary>The name of the processor that caused the fault. If the string is zero length, then it's assumed to be the endpoint.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="WS_FAULT.node">
    <summary>
      <para>The location of the processor that caused the fault. If the string is zero length, then it's assumed to be the endpoint.</para>
      <para>For <see cref="WS_ENVELOPE_VERSION_SOAP_1_1" />, this value is not serialized.</para>
    </summary>
  </member>
  <member name="WS_FAULT.detail">
    <summary>
      <para>The fault detail allows for XML content to be included along with the fault. If there is no detail, then this field may be <b>NULL</b>.</para>
      <para>For <see cref="WS_ENVELOPE_VERSION_SOAP_1_1" />, this should only be used if the fault does not relate to processing of a header of the message. Faults relating to headers should use a custom header to relay information about the fault.</para>
      <para>If there is detail for the fault, the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/wsw/ws-xml-buffer">WS_XML_BUFFER</a> should contain an element that corresponds to the detail element of a SOAP fault. The fault-specific XML content is contained within the detail element. The local name and namespace of the element are ignored; they are replaced with the appropriate element name according to the <see cref="WS_ENVELOPE_VERSION" /> when the detail element is written.</para>
