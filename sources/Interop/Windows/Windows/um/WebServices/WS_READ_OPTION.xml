    <remarks>
      <para>Each <b>WS_READ_OPTION</b> discusses when a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/wsw/ws-heap">WS_HEAP</a> object must be specified.  Depending on the function, it may still be
possible to pass a <b>NULL</b> heap parameter in this case; see the documentation
for the specific function for details on whether a default heap is used
if the heap parameter is <b>NULL</b>.</para>
      <para>The following are things to consider when deserializing values into
a heap object (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/wsw/ws-heap">WS_HEAP</a>):</para>
      <list type="bullet">
        <item>
          <description>Deserialized values remain allocated until the heap
is freed (<see cref="WsFreeHeap" />) or reset (<see cref="WsResetHeap" />).
</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>Each time values are deserialized, they are appended to the heap (instead
of replacing existing values).
</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>If errors are encountered during the deserialization function and the
function fails, the memory allocated from the heap object up until
the error will not be released.
</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>The size of the heap can be used to limit the total allocations made
during deserialization.  The max size of the heap can be determined
in the following way:
<list type="bullet"><item><description>Determine the max size, in bytes, of each value that will be
allocated on the heap during deserialization. Remember to take into
account that sizes of deserialized data structures may vary by platform.
</description></item><item><description>Each array is considered one value.  Note that the actual size of an item
in the array may by affected by the required alignment of the item.
</description></item><item><description>Round the max size of each value to a 16-byte boundary.

      <para>The option specifies that the value must exist in the XML content.</para>
      <para>The caller must specify the storage to read the top-level type into.</para>
      <para>The size of the storage specified by the caller varies by the type
being deserialized, as follows:</para>
      <list type="bullet">
        <item>
          <description>For primitives (such as <see cref="WS_INT32_TYPE" />), the storage should
be the size of the primitive.  In this case, the heap does not need to be specified.

        <item>
          <description>For structures (whether user defined ones that use <see cref="WS_STRUCT_TYPE" />,
or predefined ones like <see cref="WS_STRING" />), the storage should be the
exact size of the structure.
Note that fields of the structure that point to other data is still required to
be allocated from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/wsw/ws-heap">WS_HEAP</a>.  If no fields exist for the
specific structure, then the heap does not need to be specified.
