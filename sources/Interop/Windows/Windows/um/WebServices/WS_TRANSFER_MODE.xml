      <para>Setting this flag means messages are delivered in chunks. The start of the message (opening tag, headers, and opening body tag) will be returned to the application when <see cref="WsReadMessageStart" /> completes. It is up to the application to call<see cref="WsFillBody" /> before reading each chunk of the message body. The end of the message (closing body and envelope tags) will be read when <see cref="WsReadMessageEnd" /> is called.</para>
      <para>Not setting this flag means the entire message is read and buffered in memory before <see cref="WsReadMessageStart" /> indicates completion.</para>

      <para>Setting this flag means messages are transmitted in chunks. The start of the message (opening envelope tag, headers, and opening body tag) will be transmitted when <see cref="WsWriteMessageStart" /> is called. It is up to the application to call <see cref="WsFlushBody" /> after writing each chunk of the message body to cause the chunk to be transmitted. Any remaining body data will be transmitted when <see cref="WsWriteMessageEnd" /> is called, along with the end of the message (closing body and envelope tags).</para>
      <para>Not setting this flag means the entire message is buffered in memory and is only transmitted once <see cref="WsWriteMessageEnd" /> is called.</para>
