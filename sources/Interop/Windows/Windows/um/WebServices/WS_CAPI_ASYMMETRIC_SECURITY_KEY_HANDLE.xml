    <summary>
      <para>The type for specifying asymmetric cryptographic keys as CAPI 1.0 key
handles.</para>
      <para>When this structure is used in an API (such as
with <see cref="XML token creation" /> and subsequent
<see cref="use of that XML token" /> for a channel), the application is responsible for making
sure that the HCRYPTPROV remains valid as long as the key is in
use.  The application is also responsible for freeing the handle when
it is no longer in use.</para>
      <para>This type is supported only on pre-Windows Vista platforms: for
Windows Vista and later, please use <see cref="WS_NCRYPT_ASYMMETRIC_SECURITY_KEY_HANDLE" />.</para>
