  <member name="WS_USERNAME_MESSAGE_SECURITY_BINDING_TEMPLATE">
    <summary>
      <para>The security binding template for specifying the use of an application supplied username / password pair as a direct (i.e., one-shot) security token. This security binding may be used only with message security. It provides client authentication, but not traffic signing or encryption. So, it is used in conjunction with another transport security or message security binding that provides message protection.</para>
