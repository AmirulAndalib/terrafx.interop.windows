    <summary>
      <para>Defines how <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/wsw/extended-protection">Extended Protection</a> is validated. For most configurations, the runtime can automatically determine what needs to
be validated based on the presence of the <see cref="WS_SSL_TRANSPORT_SECURITY_BINDING" />. However, if the SSL connection is terminated at
an intermediary such as a proxy prior to reaching the server then the validation method must change, and this scenario cannot be automatically detected.</para>
      <para>Only available on the server.</para>
