    <summary>
      <para>This addressing version indicates that the only addressing headers supported are those that are natively supported by the underlying transport (there are no addressing-related headers that are transmitted as part of the SOAP envelope).</para>
      <para>The <see cref="WS_ACTION_HEADER" /> and <b>WS_TO_HEADER</b> are automatically mapped to/from the transport-specific message locations when messages are sent/received. Use of other <b>WS_HEADER_TYPE</b> are not supported for this addressing version.</para>
      <para>This addressing version is only supported for <see cref="WS_HTTP_CHANNEL_BINDING" />. Since the SOAP over HTTP protocol does not support sending an action on a reply, the value of the <see cref="WS_ACTION_HEADER" /> will not be transmitted by the channel.</para>
