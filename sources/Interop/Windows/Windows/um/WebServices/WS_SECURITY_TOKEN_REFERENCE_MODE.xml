    <summary>
      <para>With message and mixed-mode security bindings, the mechanism to use to
refer to a security token from signatures, encrypted items and derived
tokens.  The security runtime can use the right reference on its own
most of the time, and this needs to be explicitly set only when a
specific reference mechanism is required, typically for interop with
another platform that supports only that reference form.</para>
