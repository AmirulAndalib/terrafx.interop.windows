      <para>Some sector types are not compatible with other sector types within a single image.  The following are typical examples of this condition:</para>
      <list type="bullet">
        <item>
          <description>If the first track is audio, then all tracks must be audio.</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>If the first track is Mode1, then all tracks must be Mode1.</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>Only the three Mode2 (XA) sectors (Mode 2 Form 0, Mode 2 Form 1, and Mode 2 Form 2) may be mixed within a single disc image, and even then, only with other Mode 2 (XA) sector types.</description>

    <summary>
      <para>With this sector type, Audio data has 2352 bytes per sector/frame.  This can be broken down into 588 contiguous samples, each sample being four bytes.  The layout of a single sample matches the 16-bit stereo 44.1KHz WAV file data.  This type of sector has no additional error correcting codes.</para>

  <member name="IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_TYPE.IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_MODE_ZERO">
    <summary>
      <para>With this sector type, user data has 2336 bytes per sector/frame.  This seldom-used sector type contains all zero data, and is almost never seen in media today.</para>

  <member name="IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_TYPE.IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_MODE1">
    <summary>
      <para>With this sector type, user data has 2048 bytes per sector/frame.  Mode1 data is the most common data form for pressed CD-ROM media.  This data type also provides the greatest level of ECC/EDC among the standard sector types.</para>

  <member name="IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_TYPE.IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_MODE2FORM0">
    <summary>
      <para>With this sector type, user data has 2336 bytes per sector/frame.  All Mode 2 sector types are also known as "CD-ROM XA" modes, which allows mixing of audio and data tracks on a single disc.  This sector type is also known as Mode 2 "Formless", is considered deprecated, and is very seldom used.</para>

      <para>With this sector type, user data has 2048 bytes per sector/frame.  All Mode 2 sector types are also known as "CD-ROM XA" modes, which allows mixing of audio and data tracks on a single disc.</para>

  <member name="IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_TYPE.IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_MODE2FORM2">
    <summary>
      <para>With this sector type, user data has 2336 bytes per sector/frame, of which the final four bytes are an optional CRC code (zero if not used).  All Mode 2 sector types are also known as "CD-ROM XA" modes, which allows mixing of audio and data tracks on a single disc.  This sector type is most often used when writing VideoCD discs.</para>
