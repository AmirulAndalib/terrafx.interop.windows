    <summary>Defines the sector types that can be written to CD media.</summary>

  <member name="IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_TYPE.IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_AUDIO">
    <summary>With this sector type, Audio data has 2352 bytes per sector/frame. This can be broken down into 588 contiguous samples, each sample being four bytes. The layout of a single sample matches the 16-bit stereo 44.1KHz WAV file data. This type of sector has no additional error correcting codes.</summary>

  <member name="IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_TYPE.IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_MODE_ZERO">
    <summary>With this sector type, user data has 2336 bytes per sector/frame. This seldom-used sector type contains all zero data, and is almost never seen in media today.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_TYPE.IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_MODE1">
    <summary>With this sector type, user data has 2048 bytes per sector/frame. Mode1 data is the most common data form for pressed CD-ROM media. This data type also provides the greatest level of ECC/EDC among the standard sector types.</summary>

  <member name="IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_TYPE.IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_MODE2FORM0">
    <summary>With this sector type, user data has 2336 bytes per sector/frame. All Mode 2 sector types are also known as "CD-ROM XA" modes, which allows mixing of audio and data tracks on a single disc. This sector type is also known as Mode 2 "Formless", is considered deprecated, and is very seldom used.</summary>

  <member name="IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_TYPE.IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_MODE2FORM1">
    <summary>With this sector type, user data has 2048 bytes per sector/frame. All Mode 2 sector types are also known as "CD-ROM XA" modes, which allows mixing of audio and data tracks on a single disc.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_TYPE.IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_MODE2FORM2">
    <summary>With this sector type, user data has 2336 bytes per sector/frame, of which the final four bytes are an optional CRC code (zero if not used). All Mode 2 sector types are also known as "CD-ROM XA" modes, which allows mixing of audio and data tracks on a single disc. This sector type is most often used when writing VideoCD discs.</summary>

    <summary>With this sector type, user data has 2352 bytes per sector/frame. This is pre-processed Mode1Cooked data sectors, with sector header, ECC/EDC, and scrambling already added to the data stream.</summary>
