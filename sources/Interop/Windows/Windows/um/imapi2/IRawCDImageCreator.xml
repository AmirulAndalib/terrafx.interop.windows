      <para>This method can only be called prior to adding any tracks to the image.  The <i>data</i> stream must be at least 2 seconds (or 150 sectors) long.</para>
      <para>The  <i>data</i> stream should not result final sector exceeding LBA 397,799 (MSF 88:25:74), as the minimal-sized track plus leadout would then exceed the MSF 89:59:74 maximum.  Additionally, it is recommended that the <see cref="IMAPI_CD_SECTOR_TYPE" />  value for the first track is implicitly defined as "Audio". The resulting audio can then only be heard by playing the first track and "rewinding" back to the start of the audio disc.</para>
