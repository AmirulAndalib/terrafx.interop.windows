  <member name="PERFORMANCE_INFORMATION.CommitTotal">
    <summary>The number of pages currently committed by the system. Note that committing pages (using <see cref="VirtualAlloc" /> with MEM_COMMIT) changes this value immediately; however, the physical memory is not charged until the pages are accessed.</summary>

  <member name="PERFORMANCE_INFORMATION.CommitLimit">
    <summary>The current maximum number of pages that can be committed by the system without extending the paging file(s). This number can change if memory is added or deleted, or if pagefiles have grown, shrunk, or been added. If the paging file can be extended, this is a soft limit.</summary>

    <summary>The maximum number of pages that were simultaneously in the committed state since the last system reboot.</summary>
