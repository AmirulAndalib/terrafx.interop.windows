  <member name="CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER_FIELD_TYPE">
    <summary>
      <para>Specifies a type of credential field. Used by <see cref="CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER_FIELD_DESCRIPTOR" />.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>This type enables you to specify the different elements your credential provider will need to display to the user. Credential providers are not responsible for drawing their own UI, so they need to define the elements that are necessary. This type is one of the elements to support that mechanism.</para>

    <summary>
      <para>A bitmap that is shown as the user tile image. This bitmap cannot be edited. All credential providers must contain no more than one <b>CPFT_TILE_IMAGE</b>. If no image is specified, Logon UI and Credential UI will supply a default tile image.</para>

  <member name="CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER_FIELD_TYPE.CPFT_SUBMIT_BUTTON">
    <summary>
      <para>This field appears as a button on the credential tile. Pressing the button lets the user submit their credentials. There is exactly one <b>CPFT_SUBMIT_BUTTON</b> on any credential tile. Unlike Logon UI, which draws a special submit button in the tile layout, Credential UI hides this field and renders a single submit button for all credentials.</para>
