  <member name="CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER_FIELD_INTERACTIVE_STATE.CPFIS_FOCUSED">
    <summary>Credential providers use this field interactive state to indicate that the field should receive initial keyboard focus. This interactive state may not be specified for field types that the user cannot edit. If several editable fields specify this state, the last of them based on <i>dwIndex</i> order receives focus. On systems before Windows 10, it was the first of editable fields based on <i>dwIndex</i> order. This field interactive state is obeyed only during initial enumeration.</summary>
