  <member name="CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER_USAGE_SCENARIO">
    <summary>Declares the scenarios in which a credential provider is supported. A credential provider usage scenario (CPUS) enables the credential provider to provide distinct enumeration behavior and UI field setup across scenarios. When an <see cref="ICredentialProvider" /> is initialized, it calls <see cref="ICredentialProvider.SetUsageScenario" /> to set what usage scenario is supported. That scenario is maintained for the entire lifetime of the credential provider.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER_USAGE_SCENARIO.CPUS_INVALID">
    <summary>No usage scenario has been set for the credential provider. The scenario is not passed to <see cref="ICredentialProvider.SetUsageScenario" />. If a credential provider stores its current usage scenario as a class member, this provides an initialization value before the first call to <b>ICredentialProvider.SetUsageScenario</b>.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER_USAGE_SCENARIO.CPUS_LOGON">
    <summary>Workstation logon or unlock. See the remarks for more details. Credential providers that implement this scenario should be prepared to serialize credentials to the local authority for authentication.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER_USAGE_SCENARIO.CPUS_UNLOCK_WORKSTATION">
    <summary>Workstation unlock. Credential providers that implement this scenario should be prepared to serialize credentials to the local authority for authentication. These credential providers also need to enumerate the currently logged-in user as the default tile.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER_USAGE_SCENARIO.CPUS_CHANGE_PASSWORD">
    <summary>Password change. This enables a credential provider to enumerate tiles in response to a user's request to change the password. Do not implement this scenario if you do not require some secret information from the user such as a password or PIN. These credential providers also need to enumerate the currently logged-in user as the default tile.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER_USAGE_SCENARIO.CPUS_CREDUI">
    <summary>Credential UI. This scenario enables you to use credentials serialized by the credential provider to be used as authentication on remote machines. This is also the scenario used for over-the-shoulder prompting in User Access Control. This scenario uses a different instance of the credential provider than the one used for <b>CPUS_LOGON</b>, <b>CPUS_UNLOCK_WORKSTATION</b>, and <b>CPUS_CHANGE_PASSWORD</b>, so the state of the credential provider cannot be maintained across the different scenarios.</summary>

  <member name="CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER_USAGE_SCENARIO.CPUS_PLAP">
    <summary>
      <para>Pre-Logon-Access Provider. Credential providers responding to this usage scenario must register under:</para>
      <para>
        <b>HKLM</b>\<b>SOFTWARE</b>\<b>Microsoft</b>\<b>Windows</b>\<b>CurrentVersion</b>\<b>Authentication</b>\<b>PLAP Providers</b></para>
