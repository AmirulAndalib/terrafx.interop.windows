    <summary>
      <para>Contains device properties (Human Interface Device (HID) global items that correspond to HID usages) for any type of HID input device.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>The HID working group publishes a set of documents that make up the HID Usage Tables (the dictionary that describes what HID devices are allowed to do). These HID Usage Tables contain a list with Usage descriptions. A Usage provides information to an application developer about the intended meaning and use of a particular item described in the Report Descriptor. For example, there is a Usage defined for the left button of a mouse. The Report Descriptor can define where in a report an application can find the current state of the mouse’s left button. The Usage Tables are broken up into several name spaces, called Usage Pages. Each Usage Page describes a set of related Usages to help organize the document. The combination of a Usage Page and Usage defines the Usage ID that uniquely identifies a specific Usage in the Usage Tables.</para>
