  <member name="USAGE_PROPERTIES.level">
    <summary>A usage-specific value for a range-based linear control (knob or dial), an on/off control (toggle switch), a momentary control (mouse button), a one-shot control (button that triggers a single event), or re-trigger control (button that triggers a repeating event).</summary>
