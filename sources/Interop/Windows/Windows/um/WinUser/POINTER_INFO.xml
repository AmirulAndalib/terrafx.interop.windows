  <member name="POINTER_INFO.pointerId">
    <summary>
      <para>Type: <b>UINT32</b></para>
      <para>An identifier that uniquely identifies a pointer during its lifetime. A pointer comes into existence when it is first detected and ends its existence when it goes out of detection range. Note that if a physical entity (finger or pen) goes out of detection range and then returns to be detected again, it is treated as a new pointer and may be assigned a new pointer identifier.</para>

  <member name="POINTER_INFO.frameId">
    <summary>
      <para>Type: <b>UINT32</b></para>
      <para>An identifier common to multiple pointers for which the source device reported an update in a single input frame. For example, a parallel-mode multi-touch digitizer may report the positions of multiple touch contacts in a single update to the system.</para>
      <para>Note that frame identifier is assigned as input is reported to the system for all pointers across all devices. Therefore, this field may not contain strictly sequential values in a single series of messages that a window receives. However, this field will contain the same numerical value for all input updates that were reported in the same input frame by a single device.</para>

      <para>The predicted screen coordinates of the pointer, in pixels.</para>
      <para>The predicted value is based on the pointer position reported by the digitizer and the motion of the pointer. This correction can compensate for visual lag due to inherent delays in sensing and processing the pointer location on the digitizer. This is applicable to  pointers of type <see cref="PT_TOUCH" />. For other pointer types, the predicted value will be the same as the non-predicted value (see <b>ptPixelLocationRaw</b>).</para>

  <member name="POINTER_INFO.dwTime">
    <summary>
      <para>Type: <b>DWORD</b></para>
      <para>0 or the time stamp of the message, based on the system tick count when the message was received.</para>
      <para>The application can specify the input time stamp in either <b>dwTime</b> or <b>PerformanceCount</b>. The value cannot be more recent than the current tick count or <b>QueryPerformanceCount (QPC)</b> value of the injection thread. Once a frame is injected with a time stamp, all subsequent frames must include a timestamp until all contacts in the frame go to an <see cref="UP" /> state. The custom timestamp value must also be provided for the first element in the contacts array. The time stamp values after the first element are ignored. The custom timestamp value must increment in every injection frame.</para>
      <para>When <b>PerformanceCount</b> is specified, the time stamp will be converted to the current time in .1 millisecond resolution upon actual injection. If a custom <b>PerformanceCount</b> resulted in the same .1 millisecond window from the previous injection, <b>ERROR_NOT_READY</b> is returned and injection will not occur. While injection will not be invalidated immediately by the error, the next successful injection must have a <b>PerformanceCount</b> value that is at least 0.1 millisecond from the previously successful injection. This is also true if <b>dwTime</b> is used.</para>
      <para>If both <b>dwTime</b> and <b>PerformanceCount</b> are specified in <see cref="InjectTouchInput" />, ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER is returned.</para>
      <para>
        <see cref="InjectTouchInput" /> cannot switch between <b>dwTime</b> and <b>PerformanceCount</b> once injection has started.</para>
      <para>If neither <b>dwTime</b> and <b>PerformanceCount</b> are specified, <see cref="InjectTouchInput" /> allocates the timestamp based on the timing of the call. If <b>InjectTouchInput</b> calls are  repeatedly less than 0.1 millisecond apart, ERROR_NOT_READY might be returned. The error will not invalidate the input immediately, but the injection application needs to retry the same frame again for injection to succeed.</para>
