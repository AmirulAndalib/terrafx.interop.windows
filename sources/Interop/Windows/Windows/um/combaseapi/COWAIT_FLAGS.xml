    <summary>
      <para>If set, the call to <see cref="CoWaitForMultipleHandles" /> will return S_OK only when all handles associated with the synchronization object have been signaled and an input event has been received, all at the same time.  In this case, the behavior of <b>CoWaitForMultipleHandles</b> corresponds to  the behavior of the <see cref="MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx" /> function with the <i>dwFlags</i> parameter set to <b>MWMO_WAITALL</b>. If <b>COWAIT_WAITALL</b> is not set, the call to <b>CoWaitForMultipleHandles</b> will return S_OK as soon as any handle associated with the synchronization object has been signaled, regardless of whether an input event is received.</para>

      <para>If set, the call to <see cref="CoWaitForMultipleHandles" /> will return S_OK if an asynchronous procedure call (APC) has been queued to the calling thread with a call to the <see cref="QueueUserAPC" /> function, even if no handle has been signaled.</para>

      <para>Enables dispatch of window messages from <see cref="CoWaitForMultipleHandles" /> in an ASTA or STA. Default in ASTA is no window messages dispatched, default in STA is only a small set of special-cased messages dispatched. The value has no meaning in MTA and is ignored.</para>
