    <summary>Contains parameters used to describe a property page to a property frame. A property page fills a caller-provided structure in the <see cref="IPropertyPage.GetPageInfo" /> method.</summary>

  <member name="PROPPAGEINFO.cb">
    <summary>The size of the structure, in bytes.</summary>

  <member name="PROPPAGEINFO.pszTitle">
    <summary>Pointer to an <see cref="OLESTR" /> that contains the string that appears in the tab for this page. The string must be allocated with <see cref="CoTaskMemAlloc" />. The caller of <see cref="IPropertyPage.GetPageInfo" /> is responsible for freeing the memory with <see cref="CoTaskMemFree" />.</summary>

  <member name="PROPPAGEINFO.size">
    <summary>Required dimensions of the page's dialog box, in pixels.</summary>

  <member name="PROPPAGEINFO.pszDocString">
    <summary>Pointer to a text string describing the page, which can be displayed in the property sheet dialog box (current frame implementation doesn't use this field). The text must be allocated with <see cref="CoTaskMemAlloc" />. The caller of <see cref="IPropertyPage.GetPageInfo" /> is responsible for freeing the memory with <see cref="CoTaskMemFree" />.</summary>

  <member name="PROPPAGEINFO.pszHelpFile">
    <summary>Pointer to an <see cref="OLESTR" /> that contains the simple name of the help file that describes this property page used instead of implementing <see cref="IPropertyPage.Help" />. When the user presses Help, the Help method is normally called. If that method fails, the frame will open the help system with this help file (prefixed with the value of the HelpDir key in the property page's registry entries under its CLSID) and will instruct the help system to display the context described by the <b>dwHelpContext</b> field. The path must be allocated with <see cref="CoTaskMemAlloc" />. The caller of <see cref="IPropertyPage.GetPageInfo" /> is responsible for freeing the memory with <see cref="CoTaskMemFree" />.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="PROPPAGEINFO.dwHelpContext">
    <summary>Context identifier for the help topic within <b>pszHelpFile</b> that describes this page.</summary>
