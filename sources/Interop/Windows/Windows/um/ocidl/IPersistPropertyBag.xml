    <param name="pPropBag">The address of the caller's property bag, through which the object can read properties. This cannot be NULL.</param>
    <param name="pErrorLog">The address of the caller's error log, in which the object stores any errors that occur during initialization. This can be NULL; in which case, the caller does not receive errors.</param>

    <param name="pPropBag">The address of the caller's property bag, through which the object can write properties. This cannot be NULL.</param>
    <param name="fClearDirty">A flag indicating whether the object should clear its dirty flag when the "Save" operation is complete. TRUE means clear the flag, and FALSE means leave the flag unaffected. FALSE is used when the caller performs a "Save Copy As" operation.</param>
