    <remarks>
      <para>When the <b>Pull</b> method is called, data is requested from the provider of the pipe. The caller must provide a buffer that will hold at least the number of bytes specified in the <i>cRequest</i> parameter. The proxy will unmarshal the data into the provided buffer and set the number of bytes actually provided in <i>pcReturned</i>. The <i>pcReturned</i> parameter can be less than or equal to <i>cRequest</i>, but it will never be greater. When <i>pcReturned</i> is 0, it indicates that there is no more data.</para>

      <para>When the <b>Push</b> method is called, the data is being sent to the provider of the pipe. The caller fills the buffer with the data and then calls <b>Push</b>. The number of bytes being sent is specified in the <i>cSent</i> parameter. The caller is responsible for ensuring that the buffer is valid for the duration of the call.</para>
      <para>When the last of the data has been pushed, the caller must do one last push of <i>cSent</i> equal to 0 to indicate that the data transfer is complete.</para>

    <remarks>
      <para>The <b>IPipeByte</b>, <see cref="IPipeDouble" />, and <see cref="IPipeLong" /> interfaces are similar to the standard DCE/RPC pipes. However, the COM implementation of pipes offers more flexibility. With the COM implementation, the basic idea is that the pipe is simply another interface with two methods: <see cref="Pull" /> and <see cref="Push" />. This results in three main benefits:</para>
      <list type="bullet">
        <item>
          <description>A COM pipe is another interface, so it can be received as an out parameter from a method call and then either <see cref="Pull" /> or <see cref="Push" /> can be called. </description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>There are no restrictions on when to call the <see cref="Pull" /> and <see cref="Push" /> methods, so a pipe is in reality bidirectional.</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>Pipes are interfaces, so the method calls can be asynchronous and follow those rules.</description>
