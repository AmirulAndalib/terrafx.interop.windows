    <remarks>
      <para>The <b>Cancel</b> method only issues a cancel request. A return value of S_OK does not mean that the call was canceled, only that an attempt was made to cancel the call. The behavior of the cancel object on receiving a cancel request is entirely at the discretion of the implementer.</para>
      <para>If a method that returns an <b>HRESULT</b> is canceled, the return value will be RPC_S_CALL_CANCELED.</para>

    <remarks>
      <para>The server object calls <b>TestCancel</b> to determine if the call has been canceled. If the call has been canceled, the server should clean up the necessary resources and return control to the client.</para>
