  <member name="IServerSecurity.ImpersonateClient">
    <summary>Enables a server to impersonate a client for the duration of a call.</summary>
    <returns>If the method succeeds, the return value is S_OK. Otherwise, it is E_FAIL.</returns>
  </member>
  <member name="IServerSecurity.IsImpersonating">
    <summary>Indicates whether the server is currently impersonating the client.</summary>
    <returns>If the thread is currently impersonating, the return value is <b>TRUE</b>. Otherwise, it is <b>FALSE</b>.</returns>
  </member>
  <member name="IServerSecurity.QueryBlanket">
    <summary>Retrieves information about the client that invoked one of the server's methods.</summary>
    <param name="pAuthnSvc">A pointer to the current authentication service. This will be a single value taken from the list of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/com/com-authentication-service-constants">authentication service constants</a>. If the caller specifies <b>NULL</b>, the current authentication service is not retrieved.</param>
    <param name="pAuthzSvc">A pointer to a variable that receives the current authorization service. This will be a single value from the list of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/com/com-authorization-constants">authorization constants</a>. If the caller specifies <b>NULL</b>, the current authorization service is not retrieved.</param>
    <param name="pServerPrincName">The current principal name. The string will be allocated by the callee using <see cref="CoTaskMemAlloc" />, and must be freed by the caller using <see cref="CoTaskMemFree" />. By default, Schannel principal names will be in the msstd form. The fullsic form will be returned if EOAC_MAKE_FULLSIC is specified in the <i>pCapabilities</i> parameter. For more information on the msstd and fullsic forms, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/Rpc/principal-names">Principal Names</a>. If the caller specifies <b>NULL</b>, the current principal name is not retrieved.</param>
    <param name="pAuthnLevel">A pointer to a variable that receives the current authentication level. This will be a single value taken from the list of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/com/com-authentication-level-constants">authentication level constants</a>. If the caller specifies <b>NULL</b>, the current authentication level is not retrieved.</param>
    <param name="pImpLevel">This parameter must be <b>NULL</b>.</param>
    <param name="pPrivs">The privilege information for the client application. The format of the structure that the handle refers to depends on the authentication service. The application should not write or free the memory. The information is only valid for the duration of the current call. For NTLMSSP, and Kerberos, this is a <see cref="SEC_WINNT_AUTH_IDENTITY" /> or <see cref="SEC_WINNT_AUTH_IDENTITY_EX" /> structure. For Schannel, this is a <see cref="CERT_CONTEXT" /> structure that represents the client's certificate. If the client has no certificate, <b>NULL</b> is returned. If the caller specifies <b>NULL</b>, the current privilege information is not retrieved.</param>
    <param name="pCapabilities">The capabilities of the call. To request that the principal name be returned in fullsic form if Schannel is the authentication service, the caller can set the EOAC_MAKE_FULLSIC flag in this parameter. If the caller specifies <b>NULL</b>, the current capabilities are not retrieved.</param>
    <returns>This method can return the standard return values E_INVALIDARG, E_OUTOFMEMORY, and S_OK.</returns>

  <member name="IServerSecurity.RevertToSelf">
    <summary>Restores the authentication information of a thread to what it was before impersonation began.</summary>
    <returns>If the method succeeds, the return value is S_OK. Otherwise, it is E_FAIL.</returns>
