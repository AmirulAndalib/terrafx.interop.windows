    <summary>
      <para>Represents an interface in a query for multiple interfaces.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>To optimize network performance, most remote activation functions take an array of <b>MULTI_QI</b> structures rather than just a single IID as input and a single pointer to the requested interface on the object as output, as do local activation functions. This allows a set of pointers to interfaces to be returned from the same object in a single round-trip to the server. In network scenarios, requesting multiple interfaces at the time of object construction can save considerable time over using a number of calls to <see cref="QueryInterface" /> for unique interfaces, each of which would require a round-trip to the server.</para>
