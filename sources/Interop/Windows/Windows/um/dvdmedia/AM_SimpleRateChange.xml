      <para>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a> and <see cref="IMFMediaEngine" />. <b>MediaPlayer</b> and <b>IMFMediaEngine</b> have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <b>MediaPlayer</b> and <b>IMFMediaEngine</b> instead of <b>DirectShow</b>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</para>

  <member name="AM_SimpleRateChange.StartTime">
    <summary>Specifies the time stamp on the input sample when the new rate takes effect. The new rate applies to all samples with a time stamp &gt;= <b>StartTime</b> and less than the start time on the next queued rate segment.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="AM_SimpleRateChange.Rate">
    <summary>Specifies the new rate x 10000. Rate is the inverse of speed. For example, if the playback speed is 2x, the rate is 1/2, so the <b>Rate</b> member is set to 5000.</summary>
