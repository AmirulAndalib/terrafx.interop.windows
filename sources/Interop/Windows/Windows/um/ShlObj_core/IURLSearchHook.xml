    <summary>
      <para>Exposes a method that is used by the browser to translate the address of an unknown URL protocol.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>When attempting to browse to a URL address that does not contain a protocol, the browser will first attempt to determine the correct protocol from the address. If this is not successful, the browser will create URL Search Hook objects and call each object's <see cref="Translate" /> method until the address is translated or all of the hooks have been queried.</para>
      <para>URL Search Hooks are registered by adding a value that contains the object's class identifier (CLSID) string under the following key in the registry:</para>
      <code>
        <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</b>
        <b>Software</b>
        <b>Microsoft</b>
        <b>Internet Explorer</b>
        <b>UrlSearchHooks</b>
      </code>
      <para>Implement this interface if your application defines a custom URL protocol and if address translation for this protocol is required.</para>
      <para>You do not typically use this interface; it is called by the browser.</para>
