  <member name="IDockingWindowSite.GetBorderDW">
    <summary>Gets the border space allocated for the specified <see cref="IDockingWindow" /> object.</summary>
    <param name="punkObj">Pointer to the <see cref="IDockingWindow" /> object for which the border space is being requested.</param>
    <param name="prcBorder">Pointer to a structure that, when this method returns successfully, receives the entire available border space for the browser. The docking window object should use this information to determine where to place itself. See the <see cref="IDockingWindow.ResizeBorderDW" /> method for more information.</param>
    <returns>If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.</returns>

  <member name="IDockingWindowSite.RequestBorderSpaceDW">
    <summary>Approves, modifies, or refuses a request for an <see cref="IDockingWindow" /> object's border space. The border space is not allocated until the <see cref="SetBorderSpaceDW" /> method is called.</summary>
    <param name="punkObj">Pointer to the <see cref="IDockingWindow" /> object for which the border space is being requested.</param>
    <param name="pbw">A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/cc136564(v=vs.85)">BORDERWIDTHS</a> structure. Before calling this method, the structure must be filled with the desired border space. After the method returns successfully, the structure contains the approved border space. The <see cref="IDockingWindowSite" /> object may change these values. If border space is critical, it is the caller's responsibility to determine if the returned border space is sufficient.</param>
    <returns>Returns S_OK if the border space request is approved or modified, or an error value otherwise.</returns>

  <member name="IDockingWindowSite.SetBorderSpaceDW">
    <summary>Allocates and reserves border space for an <see cref="IDockingWindow" /> object.</summary>
    <param name="punkObj">A pointer to the <see cref="IDockingWindow" /> object for which the border space is being set.</param>
    <param name="pbw">A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/cc136564(v=vs.85)">BORDERWIDTHS</a> structure that contains the coordinates of the <see cref="IDockingWindow" /> object's border space. The border space should be approved through a successful call to the <see cref="IDockingWindowSite.RequestBorderSpaceDW" /> method before <b>SetBorderSpaceDW</b> is called with these coordinates.</param>
    <returns>If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.</returns>
