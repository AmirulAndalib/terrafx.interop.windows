    <summary>
      <para>Closes the software device handle.  When the handle is closed, if the lifetime of the SwDevice is <b>SWDeviceLifetimeHandle</b>, PnP will initiate the process of "unplugging" the device. The device will no longer be reported as a child of its parent device.</para>

    <param name="hSwDevice">
      <para>The <b>HSWDEVICE</b> handle to close.</para>
    </param>
    <remarks>
      <para>After <b>SwDeviceClose</b> returns, the operating system is guaranteed to not call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/api/swdevice/nc-swdevice-sw_device_create_callback">SW_DEVICE_CREATE_CALLBACK</a> callback function, and any calls to Software Device API functions that were in progress are  guaranteed to have completed.</para>
      <para>You can call <b>SwDeviceClose</b> at any time even if the callback function hasn't been called yet.</para>
      <para>In Windows 8, you can't call <b>SwDeviceClose</b> inside the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/api/swdevice/nc-swdevice-sw_device_create_callback">SW_DEVICE_CREATE_CALLBACK</a> callback function.  Doing so will cause a deadlock.  Be careful of releasing a ref counted object that will call <b>SwDeviceClose</b> when its destructor runs.  In Windows 8.1, this restriction is lifted, and you can call <b>SwDeviceClose</b> inside the callback function.</para>
      <para>By calling <b>SwDeviceClose</b>, if the lifetime of the SwDevice is <b>SWDeviceLifetimeHandle</b>, you initiate the process of "unplugging" the device.  This causes the device to no longer be reported as a child of its parent which causes PnP to issue a "surprise removal" of the device.  The call to <b>SwDeviceClose</b> returns before this removal is complete.  However, you can safely call <see cref="SwDeviceCreate" /> immediately  after <b>SwDeviceClose</b>.  The new create will be queued until the previous removal processing completes, and then the device will be re-created.</para>
      <para>PnP removal makes the device "Not present" and does not uninstall the device. PnP removal of a device is the same as unplugging a USB device and all of the persisted property state for the device will remain. If you wish to uninstall the device after calling <b>SwDeviceClose</b>, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows-hardware/drivers/install/how-devices-and-driver-packages-are-uninstalled#uninstalling-the-device">Uninstalling the device</a>.</para>

We also recommend that the preferred parent of a software device be a real device that the software device is extending the functionality for.  In situations where a software device doesn't have such a natural parent, create a device as a child of the root that can collect all the software devices that a component will enumerate; then, enumerate the actual software devices as children of this device grouping node.

      <para>
        <b>SwDeviceCreate</b> returns a handle that represents the device.  After this handle is closed, PnP will remove the device.</para>

      <para>There is a subtle difference between properties that are set as part of a <b>SwDeviceCreate</b> call and properties that are later set by calling <see cref="SwDevicePropertySet" />.  Properties that are set as part of <b>SwDeviceCreate</b> are stored in memory; if the device is uninstalled or a null driver wipes out the property stores, these properties are written out again by the Software Device API feature when PnP re-enumerates the devices.  This is all transparent to the client.  Properties that are set using <b>SwDevicePropertySet</b> after the enumeration don't persist in memory.  But, if you set a property by using <b>SwDeviceCreate</b>, you can update the value with <b>SwDevicePropertySet</b>, and this update is applied to the in-memory value as well as the persisted store.</para>
      <para>We recommend that all properties be specified as part of the call to <b>SwDeviceCreate</b> when possible and that these properties be specified for every call to <b>SwDeviceCreate</b>.</para>
      <para>
        <b>Note</b>  The operating system might possibly call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/api/swdevice/nc-swdevice-sw_device_create_callback">SW_DEVICE_CREATE_CALLBACK</a> before the call to <b>SwDeviceCreate</b> returns.  For this reason, the software device handle for the device is supplied as a parameter to the callback function.</para>
      <para>You can create a software device as the child of a parent that is not present at the time.  PnP will enumerate the software device after the parent becomes present.</para>
