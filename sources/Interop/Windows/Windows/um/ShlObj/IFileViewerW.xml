    </summary>
    <param name="pszDriver">
      <para>A pointer to a buffer that contains the name of the printer device driver that should print the file. If this parameter is <b>NULL</b>, the file viewer determines which device driver to use.</para>
    </param>
    <param name="fSuppressUI">
      <para>A user interface suppression flag. If this parameter is <b>TRUE</b>, the file viewer should not display any user interface, including error messages, during the print operation. If this parameter is <b>FALSE</b>, the file viewer can show dialog boxes, as needed.</para>

    </summary>
    <param name="pvsi">
      <para>A pointer to an <see cref="FVSHOWINFO" /> structure to contain information that the file viewer uses to display the file. A file viewer can return information to the Shell by modifying the members of the structure.</para>

      <para>Returns S_OK if successful, or E_UNEXPECTED if the <see cref="ShowInitialize" /> method was not called before <b>IFileViewerW.Show</b>.</para>

  <member name="IFileViewerW.ShowInitialize">
    <summary>
      <para>Allows a file viewer to determine whether it can display a file and, if it can, to perform initialization operations before showing the file.</para>
    </summary>
    <param name="lpfsi">
      <para>A pointer to an <see cref="IFileViewerSite" /> interface. A file viewer uses this interface to retrieve the handle to the current pinned window or to specify a new pinned window.</para>

      <para>The Shell calls this method before the <see cref="IFileViewerW.Show" /> method. The Shell specifies the name of the file to display by calling the file viewer's <see cref="IPersistFile.Load" /> method.</para>

  <member name="IFileViewerW">
    <summary>
      <para>Exposes methods that designate an interface that allows a registered file viewer to be notified when it must show or print a file.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>File viewers are not supported by Windows 2000 and later systems.</para>
      <para>Implement this interface to provide a means for your registered file types to be viewed and/or printed.</para>
      <para>You do not typically use this interface. The Shell calls the interface when the user chooses the <b>Quick View</b> command from a file's shortcut menu and the file is a type that the file viewer recognizes.</para>

        <para>[!NOTE]
The shlobj.h header defines IFileViewer as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors.
