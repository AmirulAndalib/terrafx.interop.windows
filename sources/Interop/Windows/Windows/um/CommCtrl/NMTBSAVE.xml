It contains information about the button currently being saved. Applications can modify the values of the members to save additional information.</para>

      <para>Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">DWORD</a>*</b></para>
      <para>A pointer to the data stream used to store the save information. When complete, it will contain blocks of Shell-defined information for each button, alternating with blocks defined by the application. Applications may also choose to place a block of global data at the start of
<b>pData</b>. The format and length of the application-defined blocks are determined by the application. When the save starts, the Shell will pass the amount of memory it needs in
<b>cbData</b>, but no memory will be allocated. You must allocate enough memory for
<b>pData</b> to hold your data, plus the Shell's.</para>

      <para>A pointer to the start of the unused portion of the data stream. You should load your data here, and then advance
<b>pCurrent</b> to the start of the remaining unused portion. The Shell will then load the information for the next button, advance
<b>pCurrent</b>, and so on.</para>
