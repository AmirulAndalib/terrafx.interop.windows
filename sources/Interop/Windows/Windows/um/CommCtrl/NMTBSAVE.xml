  <member name="NMTBSAVE.pData">
    <summary>A pointer to the data stream used to store the save information. When complete, it will contain blocks of Shell-defined information for each button, alternating with blocks defined by the application. Applications may also choose to place a block of global data at the start of<b>pData</b>. The format and length of the application-defined blocks are determined by the application. When the save starts, the Shell will pass the amount of memory it needs in<b>cbData</b>, but no memory will be allocated. You must allocate enough memory for<b>pData</b> to hold your data, plus the Shell's.</summary>

  <member name="NMTBSAVE.pCurrent">
    <summary>A pointer to the start of the unused portion of the data stream. You should load your data here, and then advance<b>pCurrent</b> to the start of the remaining unused portion. The Shell will then load the information for the next button, advance<b>pCurrent</b>, and so on.</summary>

  <member name="NMTBSAVE.cbData">
    <summary>The size of the data stream. When the save starts,<b>cbData</b> will be set to the amount of data needed by the Shell. You should change it to the total amount allocated.</summary>
