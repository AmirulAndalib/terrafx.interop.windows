  <member name="IPropertyBag.Read">
    <summary>Reads the named property into a caller-initialized VARIANT.</summary>
    <param name="pszPropName">The address of the name of the property to read. This cannot be NULL.</param>
    <param name="pVar">The address of the caller-initialized VARIANT that receives the property value on output. The function sets the type field and the value field in the VARIANT before it returns. If the caller initialized the <code>pVar-&gt;vt</code> field on entry, the property bag attempts to change its corresponding value to this type. If the caller sets <code>pVar-&gt;vt</code> to VT_EMPTY, the property bag can use whatever type is convenient.</param>
    <param name="pErrorLog">The address of the caller's error log in which the property bag stores any errors that occur during reads. This can be NULL; in which case, the caller does not receive errors.</param>
    <returns>An HRESULT</returns>

  <member name="IPropertyBag.Write">
    <summary>Save the named property in a caller-initialized VARIANT.</summary>
    <param name="pszPropName">The address of a string containing the name of the property to write. This cannot be NULL.</param>
    <param name="pVar">The address of the caller-initialized VARIANT that holds the property value to save. The caller owns this VARIANT, and is responsible for all of its allocations. That is, the property bag does not attempt to free data in the VARIANT.</param>
