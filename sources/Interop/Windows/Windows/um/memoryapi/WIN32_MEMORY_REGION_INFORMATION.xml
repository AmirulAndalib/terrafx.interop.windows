  <member name="WIN32_MEMORY_REGION_INFORMATION.AllocationBase">
    <summary>The base address of the allocation.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="WIN32_MEMORY_REGION_INFORMATION.AllocationProtect">
    <summary>The page protection value that was specified when the allocation was created. Protections of individual pages within the allocation can be different from this value. To query protection values of individual pages, use the <see cref="VirtualQuery" /> function.</summary>

  <member name="WIN32_MEMORY_REGION_INFORMATION.DUMMYUNIONNAME.Flags">
    <summary>Represents all memory region flags as a single ULONG value. Applications should not use this field. Instead, test the individual bit field flags defined below.</summary>

  <member name="WIN32_MEMORY_REGION_INFORMATION.DUMMYUNIONNAME.DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.Private">
    <summary>A value of 1 indicates that the allocation is private to the process.</summary>

  <member name="WIN32_MEMORY_REGION_INFORMATION.DUMMYUNIONNAME.DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.MappedPhysical">
    <summary>A value of 1 indicates that the allocation is a view of the <b>\Device\PhysicalMemory</b> section.</summary>

  <member name="WIN32_MEMORY_REGION_INFORMATION.RegionSize">
    <summary>The size of the allocation.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="WIN32_MEMORY_REGION_INFORMATION.CommitSize">
    <summary>The commit charge associated with the allocation. For private allocations, this is the combined size of pages in the region that are committed, as opposed to reserved. For mapped views, this is the combined size of pages that have copy-on-write protection, or have been made private as a result of copy-on-write.</summary>
