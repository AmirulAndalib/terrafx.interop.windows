  <member name="IEnumWbemClassObject.Next">
    <summary>Use the <b>IEnumWbemClassObject.Next</b> method to get one or more objects starting at the current position in an enumeration. This method advances the current position in the enumeration by <i>uCount</i> objects, so that subsequent calls return the subsequent objects.</summary>
    <param name="lTimeout">Specifies the maximum amount of time in milliseconds that the call blocks before returning. If you use the constant <b>WBEM_INFINITE</b> (0xFFFFFFFF), the call blocks until objects are available. If you use the value 0 (<b>WBEM_NO_WAIT</b>), the call returns immediately, whether any objects are available or not.</param>
    <param name="uCount">Number of requested objects.</param>
    <param name="apObjects">Pointer to enough storage to hold the number of<see cref="IWbemClassObject" /> interface pointers specified by<i>uCount</i>. This storage must be supplied by the caller. This parameter cannot be<b>NULL</b>. The caller must call <b>Release</b> on each of the received interface pointers when they are no longer needed.</param>
    <param name="puReturned">
      <para>Pointer to a <b>ULONG</b> that receives the number of objects returned. This number can be less than the number requested in <i>uCount</i>. This pointer cannot be<b>NULL</b>.</para>
      <div>
        <b>Note</b>  The <b>Next</b> method returns <b>WBEM_S_FALSE</b> when you have reached the end of the enumeration, even if objects have been returned successfully. The <b>WBEM_S_NO_ERROR</b> value returns only when the number of objects returned matches the number requested in <i>uCount</i>. The <b>WBEM_S_TIMEDOUT</b> value is returned when the number of objects returned is less than the number requested but you are not at the end of the enumeration. Therefore, you should use loop termination logic that examines the <i>puReturned</i> value to ensure that you have reached the end of the enumeration.</div>
    </param>
    <returns>The <b>Next</b> method returns an <b>HRESULT</b> indicating the status of the method call. The following list lists the value contained within an<b>HRESULT</b>.</returns>
  </member>
  <member name="IEnumWbemClassObject.NextAsync">
    <summary>Use the <b>NextAsync</b> method when a controlled asynchronous retrieval of objects to a sink is required. Normal asynchronous retrieval, such as a call to<see cref="IWbemServices.ExecQueryAsync" />, results in uncontrolled delivery of objects to the caller's implementation of<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/WmiSdk/iwbemobjectsink">IWbemObjectSink</a>. This method is helpful for cases where a component controls object delivery.</summary>
    <param name="uCount">Number of objects being requested.</param>
    <param name="pSink">Sink to receive the objects. The sink must be implemented by the caller. As each batch of objects is requested, they are delivered to the <i>pSink</i> parameter of the<see cref="Indicate" /> method followed by a final call to the <i>pSink</i> parameter of the <see cref="SetStatus" /> method. If the sink is going to be used to deliver objects, this method returns <b>WBEM_S_NO_ERROR</b>, even if the number of objects to be delivered is less than requested. However, if there are no more objects remaining, then the <i>pSink</i> parameter is ignored (no calls to the <i>pSink</i> parameter of <b>SetStatus</b> are made). Instead, this method returns <b>WBEM_S_FALSE</b>.</param>
    <returns>The<b>NextAsync</b> method returns an <b>HRESULT</b> that indicates the status of the method call. The following list lists the value contained within an <b>HRESULT</b>.</returns>
  </member>
  <member name="IEnumWbemClassObject.Reset">
    <summary>
      <para>The<b>IEnumWbemClassObject.Reset</b> method resets an enumeration sequence back to the beginning. Because CIM objects are dynamic, calling this method does not necessarily return the same list of objects that you obtained previously.</para>
      <div>
        <b>Note</b>  This method fails if the enumerator was originally created with the <b>WBEM_FLAG_FORWARD_ONLY</b> option.</div>
    </summary>
    <returns>The<b>Reset</b> method returns an <b>HRESULT</b> indicating the status of the method call. The following list lists the value contained within an <b>HRESULT</b>.</returns>
  </member>
  <member name="IEnumWbemClassObject.Skip">
    <summary>You can use the<b>IEnumWbemClassObject.Skip</b> method to move the current position in an enumeration ahead by a specified number of objects. Also, this affects subsequent calls to<see cref="NextAsync" />, but it does not affect pending deliveries begun with<b>NextAsync</b>.</summary>
    <param name="lTimeout">Maximum amount of time in milliseconds that the call to<b>Skip</b> blocks before returning. If you use the constant <b>WBEM_INFINITE</b> (0xFFFFFFFF), the call blocks until the operation succeeds. If<b>Skip</b> cannot complete the operation before the <i>lTimeout</i> value expires, the call returns <b>WBEM_S_TIMEDOUT</b>.</param>
    <param name="nCount">Number of objects to skip. If this parameter is greater than the number of objects left to enumerate, then this call skips to the end of the enumeration and <b>WBEM_S_FALSE</b> is returned.</param>
    <returns>This method returns an <b>HRESULT</b> indicating the status of the method call. The following list lists the value contained within an <b>HRESULT</b>.</returns>
