  <member name="IUnsecuredApartment.CreateObjectStub">
    <summary>
      <para>The
<b>CreateObjectStub</b> method creates an object forwarder sink to assist in receiving asynchronous calls from Windows Management. This function binds an unsecured object sink to a local object sink so that COM security does not interfere with asynchronous retrieval of CIM objects. Because COM security is being bypassed, the remote Windows Management server is assumed to be a trusted component.</para>
      <para>The general paradigm is that the original implementation of
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/WmiSdk/iwbemobjectsink">IWbemObjectSink</a> in the client process is not directly used in asynchronous calls to
<see cref="IWbemServices" />. Rather, both the original implementation and a substitute object are created, bound together, and then the substitute object is used in the asynchronous methods of
<b>IWbemServices</b>.</para>

<b>IWbemServices</b> calls.</para>
    </param>
    <returns>
      <para>This method returns standard COM error codes for <see cref="QueryInterface" />. It returns <b>S_OK</b> if the call succeeds. If the call fails because the requested interface was not supported, the method returns <b>E_NOINTERFACE</b>.</para>
      <para>COM-specific error codes also may be returned if network problems cause you to lose the remote connection to Windows Management.</para>

    <remarks>
      <para>
        <b>Note</b>  Because the call-back to the sink might not be returned at the same authentication level as the client requires, it is recommended that you use semisynchronous instead of asynchronous communication.

    <summary>
      <para>The
<b>IUnsecuredApartment</b> interface is used to simplify the process of making asynchronous calls from a client process. When a client is making asynchronous calls, the roles of the client and the server are reversed. In this case, the client implements an object (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/WmiSdk/iwbemobjectsink">IWbemObjectSink</a> interface) and the server calls the methods of that object. Because of this, COM security rules for servers make it difficult for clients to make asynchronous calls. The primary difficulty is the fact that the client needs to inform COM that it will allow Windows Management to invoke methods on the client's object (<b>IWbemObjectSink</b>).</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>
        <b>IUnsecuredApartment</b> allows WMI to create a separate process to handle callbacks. Using this interface creates security risks, as described in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/WmiSdk/setting-security-on-an-asynchronous-call">Setting Security on an Asynchronous Call</a>. Semisynchronous access or performing access checks are recommended instead of asynchronous calls. For more information and an example of using <b>IUnsecuredApartment</b>, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/WmiSdk/lowering-the-security-for-a-sink-in-a-separate-process">Lowering the Security for a Sink in a Separate Process</a>. Use <see cref="IWbemUnsecuredApartment.CreateSinkStub" /> for a more secure approach.</para>
