      <para>The<b>IWbemConfigureRefresher</b> interface is used by client code to add enumerators, objects, and nested refreshers into a refresher.</para>
      <para>Users and providers should never implement this interface. The implementation provided by WMI is the only one that is supported.</para>
      <para>By providing a native implementation of this interface, WMI allows client code to easily configure refreshers.
