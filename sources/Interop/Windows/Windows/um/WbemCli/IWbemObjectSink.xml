  <member name="IWbemObjectSink.Indicate">
    <summary>
      <para>The<b>Indicate</b> method is called by a source to provide a notification. Typically, WMI calls the client implementation of this interface after the client executes one of the asynchronous methods of<see cref="IWbemServices" />. In other cases, various types of providers call an implementation exported by WMI to deliver events. Therefore, client code may have to implement this interface in some cases, and use a different component's implementation in other cases.</para>
      <para>Use this interface and method in conjunction with the asynchronous methods of the<see cref="IWbemServices" /> interface.</para>
      <para>Clients and providers must implement this interface to receive notifications or to execute the asynchronous methods of<see cref="IWbemServices" />. For more information, see<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/WmiSdk/calling-a-method">Calling a Method</a>.</para>
    </summary>
    <param name="lObjectCount">Number of objects in the following array of pointers.</param>
    <param name="apObjArray">Array of pointers to<see cref="IWbemClassObject" /> interfaces. The array memory itself is read-only, and is owned by the caller of the method. Because this is an in parameter, the implementation has the option of calling <see cref="IWbemClassObject.AddRef" /> on any object pointer in the array and holding it before returning if the objects will be used after the method has returned, in accordance with COM rules. If the objects are only used for the duration of the<b>Indicate</b> call, then you do not need to call <b>AddRef</b> on each object pointer.</param>
    <returns>This method returns an <b>HRESULT</b> that indicates the status of the method call. The following list lists the value contained within an <b>HRESULT</b>.</returns>
  </member>
  <member name="IWbemObjectSink.SetStatus">
    <summary>
      <para>The<b>IWbemObjectSink.SetStatus</b> method is called by sources to indicate the end of a notification sequence, or to send other status codes to the sink. The<see cref="IWbemObjectSink.Indicate" /> method may or may not have been called before the call to<b>SetStatus</b>.</para>
      <para>Typically, a client implements the<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/WmiSdk/iwbemobjectsink">IWbemObjectSink</a> interface, and executes<see cref="IWbemServices" /> methods that return their results using the<b>IWbemObjectSink</b> interface. During this operation, WMI calls<see cref="Indicate" /> as many times as required, followed by a final call to<b>SetStatus</b>, and in many cases, <see cref="Release" />.</para>
    </summary>
    <param name="lFlags">
      <para>Bitmask of status information. The status of the operation can be obtained by examining the <i>hResult</i> parameter.</para>
      <h4>WBEM_STATUS_COMPLETE</h4>
      <para>The operation has completed.</para>
      <h4>WBEM_STATUS_PROGRESS</h4>
      <para>The operation is still in progress.</para>
      <h4>WBEM_STATUS_REQUIREMENTS</h4>
      <para>Used in activating post-filtering.</para>
    </param>
    <param name="hResult">This parameter is set to the <b>HRESULT</b> of the asynchronous operation or notification. This is either an error code, if an error occurred, or the amount of progress that has been made on an asynchronous call.</param>
    <param name="strParam">Receives a pointer to a read-only <b>BSTR</b>, if the original asynchronous operation returns a string. For example, when using<see cref="PutInstanceAsync" />,<b>SetStatus</b> is called with this parameter set to the object path of the newly created instance.</param>
    <param name="pObjParam">In cases where a complex error or status object is returned, this contains a pointer to the error object. If the object is required after<b>SetStatus</b> returns, the called object must use the <see cref="AddRef" /> method on the pointer before the called object returns.</param>
    <returns>This method returns an <b>HRESULT</b> indicating the status of the method call. The following list lists the value contained within an <b>HRESULT</b>.</returns>

  <member name="IWbemObjectSink">
    <summary>
      <para>The<b>IWbemObjectSink</b> interface creates a sink interface that can receive all types of notifications within the WMI programming model. Clients must implement this interface to receive both the results of the<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/WmiSdk/making-an-asynchronous-call-with-c--">asynchronous methods</a> of<see cref="IWbemServices" />, and specific types of event notifications. Providers use, but do not implement this interface to provide events and objects to WMI.</para>
      <para>Typically, providers call an implementation provided to them by WMI. In these cases, call<see cref="Indicate" /> to provide objects to the WMI service. After that, call<see cref="SetStatus" /> to indicate the end of the notification sequence. You can also call<b>SetStatus</b> to indicate errors when the sink does not have any objects.</para>
      <para>When programming asynchronous clients of WMI, the user provides the implementation. WMI calls the methods to deliver objects and set the status of the result.</para>
      <div>
        <b>Note</b>  If a client application passes the same sink interface in two different overlapping asynchronous calls, WMI does not guarantee the order of the callback. Client applications that make overlapping asynchronous calls should either pass different sink objects, or serialize their calls.</div>
      <div>
        <b>Note</b>  Because the call-back to the sink might not be returned at the same authentication level as the client requires, it is recommended that you use semisynchronous instead of asynchronous communication.
