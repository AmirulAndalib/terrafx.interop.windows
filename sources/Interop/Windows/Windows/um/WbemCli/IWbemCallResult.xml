  <member name="IWbemCallResult.GetCallStatus">
    <summary>The<b>IWbemCallResult.GetCallStatus</b> method returns to the user the status of the current outstanding semisynchronous call. When this call returns <b>WBEM_S_NO_ERROR</b>, the original call to the<see cref="IWbemServices" /> method is complete.</summary>
    <param name="lTimeout">Specifies the maximum time in milliseconds that this call blocks before it returns. If you use the constant <b>WBEM_INFINITE</b> (0xFFFFFFFF), the call blocks until the original semisynchronous call to an<see cref="IWbemServices" /> method is complete. If you use 0 (zero), the call immediately returns the call status.</param>
    <param name="plStatus">If <b>WBEM_S_NO_ERROR</b> returns in the HRESULT to this method, this parameter will receive the final result status of a call to one of the<see cref="IWbemServices" /> methods:<see cref="OpenNamespace" />,<see cref="PutInstance" />,<see cref="PutClass" />,<see cref="GetObject" />,<see cref="DeleteInstance" />,<see cref="DeleteClass" />, or<see cref="ExecMethod" />.

    <summary>
      <para>The<b>IWbemCallResult</b> interface is used for semisynchronous calls of the<see cref="IWbemServices" /> interface. When making such calls, the called<b>IWbemServices</b> method returns immediately, along with an<b>IWbemCallResult</b> object. Periodically, you can poll the returned<b>IWbemCallResult</b> object to determine the status of the call. You can obtain the result of the original<see cref="IWbemServices" /> call after it is complete by calling<see cref="IWbemCallResult.GetCallStatus" />.</para>
      <para>This call-return paradigm is useful in cases where a thread cannot afford to be blocked for more than a few seconds because it is servicing other tasks, such as processing window messages.</para>
      <para>Not all<see cref="IWbemServices" /> methods support this interface because it is not required for all of them. The intent is to allow nonblocking, synchronous operation (semisynchronous operation) for all relevant operations. Because many of the<b>IWbemServices</b> methods are already nonblocking due to the use of enumerators or other constructs, only the following methods need this helper interface to support semisynchronous operation:</para>
