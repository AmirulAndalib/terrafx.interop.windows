  <member name="Windows.QueryPerformanceCounter">
    <summary>Retrieves the current value of the performance counter, which is a high resolution (&lt;1us) time stamp that can be used for time-interval measurements.</summary>
    <param name="lpPerformanceCount">A pointer to a variable that receives the current performance-counter value, in counts.</param>
    <returns>
      <para>If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero.</para>
      <para>If the function fails, the return value is zero. To get extended error information, call <see cref="GetLastError" />. On systems that run Windows XP or later, the function will always succeed and will thus never return zero.</para>
    </returns>

  <member name="Windows.QueryPerformanceFrequency">
    <summary>Retrieves the frequency of the performance counter. The frequency of the performance counter is fixed at system boot and is consistent across all processors. Therefore, the frequency need only be queried upon application initialization, and the result can be cached.</summary>
    <param name="lpFrequency">A pointer to a variable that receives the current performance-counter frequency, in counts per second. If the installed hardware doesn't support a high-resolution performance counter, this parameter can be zero (this will not occur on systems that run Windows XP or later).</param>
    <returns>
      <para>If the installed hardware supports a high-resolution performance counter, the return value is nonzero.</para>
      <para>If the function fails, the return value is zero. To get extended error information, call <see cref="GetLastError" />. On systems that run Windows XP or later, the function will always succeed and will thus never return zero.</para>
