    <summary>
      <para>Prevent a <see cref="per-user" /> known folder from being redirected to a network location. Note that if the known folder has been flagged with KFDF_LOCAL_REDIRECT_ONLY but it is a subfolder of a known folder that is redirected to a network location, this subfolder is redirected also.</para>

  <member name="KF_DEFINITION_FLAGS.KFDF_PRECREATE">
    <summary>
      <para>Create the folder when the user first logs on. Normally a known folder is not created until it is first called. At that time, an API such as <see cref="SHCreateItemInKnownFolder" /> or <see cref="IKnownFolder.GetShellItem" /> is called with the <see cref="KF_FLAG_CREATE" /> flag. However, some known folders need to exist immediately. An example is those known folders under %USERPROFILE%, which must exist to provide a proper view. In those cases, KFDF_PRECREATE is set and Windows Explorer calls the creation API during its user initialization.</para>
