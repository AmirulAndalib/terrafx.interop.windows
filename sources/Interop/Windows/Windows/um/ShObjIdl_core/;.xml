  </member>
  <member name=";.FOS_STRICTFILETYPES">

  </member>
  <member name=";.FOS_FORCEFILESYSTEM">
    <summary>Ensures that returned items are file system items (<see cref="SFGAO_FILESYSTEM" />). Note that this does not apply to items returned by <see cref="IFileDialog.GetCurrentSelection" />.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name=";.FOS_ALLNONSTORAGEITEMS">
    <summary>Enables the user to choose any item in the Shell namespace, not just those with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/shell/sfgao">SFGAO_STREAM</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/shell/sfgao">SFAGO_FILESYSTEM</a> attributes. This flag cannot be combined with FOS_FORCEFILESYSTEM.</summary>

  </member>
  <member name=";.FOS_ALLOWMULTISELECT">
    <summary>Enables the user to select multiple items in the open dialog. Note that when this flag is set, the <see cref="IFileOpenDialog" /> interface must be used to retrieve those items.</summary>

  </member>
  <member name=";.FOS_NOTESTFILECREATE">

    <summary>Hide the list of places from which the user has recently opened or saved items. This value is not supported as of Windows 7.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name=";.FOS_HIDEPINNEDPLACES">
    <summary>
      <para>Hide items shown by default in the view's navigation pane. This flag is often used in conjunction with the <see cref="IFileDialog.AddPlace" /> method, to hide standard locations and replace them with custom locations.</para>

    </summary>
  </member>
  <member name=";.FOS_NODEREFERENCELINKS">
    <summary>Shortcuts should not be treated as their target items. This allows an application to open a .lnk file rather than what that file is a shortcut to.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name=";.FOS_OKBUTTONNEEDSINTERACTION">
    <summary>The OK button will be disabled until the user navigates the view or edits the filename (if applicable). Note: Disabling of the OK button does not prevent the dialog from being submitted by the Enter key.</summary>

  <member name=";.FOS_DONTADDTORECENT">
