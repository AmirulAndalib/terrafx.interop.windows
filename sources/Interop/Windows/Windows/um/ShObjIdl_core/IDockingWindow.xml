  <member name="IDockingWindow.CloseDW">
    <summary>Notifies the docking window object that it is about to be removed from the frame. The docking window object should save any persistent information at this time.</summary>
    <param name="dwReserved">Reserved. This parameter should always be zero.</param>
    <returns>If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.</returns>

  <member name="IDockingWindow.ResizeBorderDW">
    <summary>Notifies the docking window object that the frame's border space has changed. In response to this method, the <see cref="IDockingWindow" /> implementation must call <see cref="SetBorderSpaceDW" />, even if no border space is required or a change is not necessary.</summary>
    <param name="prcBorder">Pointer to a <see cref="RECT" /> structure that contains the frame's available border space.</param>
    <param name="punkToolbarSite">Pointer to the site's <see cref="IUnknown" /> interface. The docking window object should call the <see cref="QueryInterface" /> method for this interface, requesting IID_IDockingWindowSite. The docking window object then uses that interface to negotiate its border space. It is the docking window object's responsibility to release this interface when it is no longer needed.</param>
    <param name="fReserved">Reserved. This parameter should always be zero.</param>
    <returns>If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.</returns>

  <member name="IDockingWindow.ShowDW">
    <summary>Instructs the docking window object to show or hide itself.</summary>
    <param name="fShow">
      <b>TRUE</b> if the docking window object should show its window. <b>FALSE</b> if the docking window object should hide its window and return its border space by calling <see cref="SetBorderSpaceDW" /> with zero values.</param>
    <returns>If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.</returns>

  <member name="IDockingWindow">
    <summary>Exposes methods that notify the docking window object of changes, including showing, hiding, and impending removal. This interface is implemented by window objects that can be docked within the border space of a Windows Explorer window.</summary>
