    <remarks>
      <para>Setting the value of <i>fFullscreen</i> to <b>TRUE</b>, the Shell treats this window as a full-screen window, and the taskbar is moved to the bottom of the z-order when this window is active. Setting the value of <i>fFullscreen</i> to <b>FALSE</b> removes the full-screen marking, but <i>does not</i> cause the Shell to treat the window as though it were definitely not full-screen. With a <b>FALSE</b><i>fFullscreen</i> value, the Shell depends on its automatic detection facility to specify how the window should be treated, possibly still flagging the window as full-screen.</para>
      <para>
        <b>Since Windows 7,</b> call <code>SetProp(hwnd, L”NonRudeHWND”, reinterpret_cast&lt;HANDLE&gt;(TRUE))</code> before showing a window to indicate to the Shell that the window should not be treated as full-screen. This ensures the taskbar does not adjust itself to be below the window in z-order. This is similar to <code>ITaskbarList2.MarkFullscreenWindow(FALSE)</code> except the Shell will not fallback to its automatic detection facility and will not treat the window as full-screen.</para>

      <para>Extends the <see cref="ITaskbarList" /> interface by exposing a method to mark a window as a full-screen display.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>This interface also provides the methods of the <see cref="ITaskbarList" /> interface, from which it inherits.</para>
      <para>The Shell also automatically attempts to detect full-screen applications, but it is not as reliable as using the <see cref="ITaskbarList2.MarkFullscreenWindow" /> method.</para>
