    <summary>
      <para>Constants used by <see cref="IFileIsInUse.GetUsage" /> to indicate how a file in use is being used.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>The interpretation of "playing" or "editing" is left to the application's implementation of <see cref="IFileIsInUse" />. Generally, "playing" would refer to a media file while "editing" can refer to any file being altered in an application. However, the application itself best knows how to map these terms to its actions.</para>
