      <para>The <b>fidParent</b> and <b>pszRelativePath</b> values work together. For example, suppose you are defining a folder called MyNewFolder and want to create that folder as ...&lt;Username&gt;\AppData\Local\MyApp\MyNewFolder. Provide <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/shell/knownfolderid">FOLDERID_LocalAppData</a> in <b>fidParent</b> to represent ...&lt;Username&gt;\AppData\Local. Provide "\MyApp\MyNewFolder" in <b>pszRelativePath</b>.</para>
