  <member name="KF_REDIRECT_FLAGS">
    <summary>
      <para>Flags used by <see cref="IKnownFolderManager.Redirect" /> to specify details of a known folder redirection such as permissions and ownership for the redirected folder.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>The <b><b>KF_REDIRECT_OWNER_USER</b></b> and <b><b>KF_REDIRECT_SET_OWNER_EXPLICIT</b></b> flags provide ownership checks for the target folder, if that folder exists. By default, <see cref="IKnownFolderManager.Redirect" /> does not perform ownership checks. KF_REDIRECT_OWNER_USER and KF_REDIRECT_SET_OWNER_EXPLICIT are only valid if called together.</para>
      <para>The <b>KF_REDIRECT_FLAGS</b> type is defined in Shobjidl.h as shown here.</para>
      <code>typedef DWORD KF_REDIRECT_FLAGS;
