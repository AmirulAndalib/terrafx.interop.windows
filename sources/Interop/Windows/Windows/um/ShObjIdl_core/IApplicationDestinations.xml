      <para>This method does not remove items that the user has pinned to the Jump List. Those items cannot be removed programmatically; only the user can remove them. However, it does remove usage data for those pinned items. It also cannot remove items from custom categories or the task list.</para>

    <summary>
      <para>Removes a single destination from the <b>Recent</b> and <b>Frequent</b> categories in a Jump List.</para>

    <param name="punk">
      <para>Type: <b><see cref="IUnknown" />*</b></para>

      <para>Returns S_OK if successful, or a standard COM error value otherwise. If the object pointed to by <i>punk</i> is not an <see cref="IShellItem" /> or <see cref="IShellLink" />, the method returns E_INVALIDARG.</para>
    </returns>
    <remarks>
      <para>A destination can appear in both the <b>Recent</b> and <b>Frequent</b> categories. If that is the case, this method removes the destination from both categories.</para>
      <para>If the item is pinned to the list by the user, it is not removed but its usage data is cleared.</para>
      <para>An application can call <b>RemoveDestination</b> without knowing if the item pointed to by <i>punk</i> is currently in the list. If there is no existing data on the item (in which case it is not in the <b>Recent</b> or <b>Frequent</b> list), this method does nothing and returns S_OK.</para>

  <member name="IApplicationDestinations.SetAppID">
    <summary>
      <para>Specifies a unique Application User Model ID (AppUserModelID) for the application from whose taskbar button's Jump List the methods of this interface will remove destinations. This method is optional.</para>
    </summary>
    <param name="pszAppID">
      <para>Type: <b>LPCWSTR</b></para>

      <para>If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.</para>

    <remarks>
      <para>If the application has an explicit AppUserModelID, this method must be called before you call <see cref="RemoveAllDestinations" /> or <see cref="RemoveDestination" />.</para>
      <para>After an AppUserModelID is specified through an object's <b>SetAppID</b> method, the AppUserModelID is saved in the object for that object's lifetime, providing that it is not overwritten by another call to <b>SetAppID</b>.</para>
      <para>Some applications will not declare an explicit AppUserModelID and should not call this method. In that case, the application's identity is deduced when <see cref="IApplicationDestinations.RemoveDestination" /> or <see cref="IApplicationDestinations.RemoveAllDestinations" /> are called. However, there is a performance benefit in avoiding those calculations, so applications that provide custom Jump Lists are encouraged to use <see cref="explicit AppUserModelIDs" />.</para>

  <member name="IApplicationDestinations">
    <summary>
      <para>Exposes methods that allow an application to remove one or all destinations from the <b>Recent</b> or <b>Frequent</b> categories in a Jump List.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <h3>When to Implement</h3>
      <para>An implementation of this interface is provided in Windows as CLSID_ApplicationDestinations. This interface is not implemented by third parties.</para>
      <h3>When to Use</h3>
      <para>An application calls the methods of this interface when it wants to remove items from a Jump List's automatically generated destinations. These destinations, found in the <b>Recent</b> or <b>Frequent</b> categories, are generated through calls to <see cref="SHAddToRecentDocs" />, either explicitly or by the system when a file is opened through Windows Explorer or the common file dialog is used to open, save, or create a file.</para>
      <para>An application should call <b>IApplicationDestinations</b> methods in the following situations:</para>
      <list type="bullet">
        <item>
          <description>When the application is uninstalled.</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>When the user clears history.</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>When the user disables destination tracking in the application's Settings or Options pages.</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>When the user deletes the destination from within the application. This is particularly important in the case of a destination that is not a file. In the case of non-file destinations—generally, though not always, <see cref="IShellLink" /> items—it is the application's responsibility to remove the destination from the list when it detects that it no longer exists.</description>
        </item>
      </list>
      <para>If the user turns off usage tracking in the application's privacy setting, the application is responsible for clearing the existing data and also stopping the system from collecting usage data on that item in the future. This is done by setting the NoRecentDocs value in all of the application's file type registrations. See <see cref="FTA_NoRecentDocs" /> for more information.</para>
      <para>
        <b>IApplicationDestinations</b> methods are used only with the automatically generated <b>Recent</b> or <b>Frequent</b> categories. They do not remove items that the user has pinned to the Jump List. Those items cannot be removed programmatically; only the user can remove them. These methods also have no effect on <see cref="custom categories" /> or the task list.</para>
