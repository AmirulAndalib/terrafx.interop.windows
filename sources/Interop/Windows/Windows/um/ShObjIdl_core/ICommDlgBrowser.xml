    <remarks>
      <para>This method is called by the <see cref="IEnumIDList" /> implementation when hosted in file dialog boxes. The enumerator calls this method to let the common dialog box filter out objects that should not be displayed. Typically, the file dialog boxes will get the display text of the item, and filter by the extension.</para>
      <h3>Note to Calling Applications</h3>
      <para>Call this method before returning an object in the Shell folder's IDLIST enumerator.</para>
      <para>When dealing with data sources that have many items, such as libraries and searches, the callback to this method results in poor performance. To avoid that situation, implement <see cref="GetViewFlags" /> and return CDB2GVF_NOINCLUDEITEM. Doing so enables the view to skip calling <b>ICommDlgBrowser.IncludeObject</b>, thereby improving performance.</para>

    <summary>
      <para>Exposed by the common file dialog boxes to be used when they host a Shell browser. If supported, <b>ICommDlgBrowser</b> exposes methods that allow a Shell view to handle several cases that require different behavior in a dialog box than in a normal Shell view. You obtain an <b>ICommDlgBrowser</b> interface pointer by calling <see cref="QueryInterface" /> on the <see cref="IShellBrowser" /> object.</para>

    <remarks>
      <para>
        <b>Note</b>  In Windows XP and earlier, this interface was defined in Shlobj.h.</para>
      <para>This interface is implemented only by the common file dialog boxes.</para>
      <para>Use <b>ICommDlgBrowser</b> when you need to provide special behavior while hosted inside the common dialog boxes.</para>
