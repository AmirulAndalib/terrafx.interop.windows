    <summary>
      <para>Exposes methods to compare two items to see if they are the same.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>This interface provides only the methods of the <see cref="IRelatedItem" /> interface, from which it inherits.</para>
      <para>Shell data sources that present items in virtual locations, such as search results, typically implement this interface as a handler to discover the actual location of an item—to find a folder that contains a file. For example, this interface is used to implement the <b>Open File Location</b> command in Windows Explorer. When the user right-clicks on a file in a set of search results, for example, and then selects <b>Open File Location</b>, the command uses <b>IIdentityName</b> to get the true item and opens a browser on its parent (the file folder) instead of opening the parent of the item (which is where the user already is).</para>
      <para>Several controls (the <b>Start</b> button on the taskbar, and the namespace control) use <b>IIdentityName</b> to get the original item and thus avoid duplicate items.</para>
      <para>This interface is helpful with aliased ID lists (type <see cref="ITEMIDLIST" />), as can be demonstrated using the following two lists.</para>
      <list type="number">
        <item>
          <description>[computer][c:][users][pat][desktop][myfile.txt]. This is a file in the user's desktop and is handled by the <see cref="IShellFolder" /> implementation in Windows Vista that handles file systems.</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>[desktop][myfile.txt]. The <see cref="IShellFolder" /> implementation behind the desktop shows files from the user's desktop, all of the user's desktop, and some special items like the <b>Recycle Bin</b>. When asked to bind through <see cref="IShellFolder.BindToObject" /> using IID IID_IIdentityName, this <b>IShellFolder</b> returns the underlying item, which is the file folder item just above.</description>
        </item>
      </list>
      <b>Note</b>  To get an instance of this handler use <see cref="IShellFolder.BindToObject" /> with <code>IID_IIdentityItem</code> or use <see cref="IShellItem.BindToHandler" /> with <code>BHID_SFObject</code>.
