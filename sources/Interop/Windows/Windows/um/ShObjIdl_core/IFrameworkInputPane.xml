  <member name="IFrameworkInputPane.Advise">
    <summary>Registers the app's input pane handler object to receive notifications on behalf of a window when an event triggers the input pane. This method differs from <see cref="AdviseWithHWND" /> in that it references its window through an object that implements <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//uwp/api/windows.ui.core.icorewindow">ICoreWindow</a>.</summary>
    <param name="pWindow">A pointer to the window (an object that implements <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//uwp/api/windows.ui.core.icorewindow">ICoreWindow</a>) for which the handler should listen for input pane events.</param>
    <param name="pHandler">An <see cref="IFrameworkInputPaneHandler" /> interface pointer to the handler instance for this app.</param>
    <param name="pdwCookie">A pointer to a value that, when this method returns successfully, receives a cookie for that can be used later to unregister the handler through the <see cref="Unadvise" /> method.</param>

  <member name="IFrameworkInputPane">
    <summary>Provides methods that enable apps to be informed of state changes and location for the input pane. The input pane is a UI element, an on-screen keyboard or handwriting panel, that appears when the user performs an action that requires them to enter information, such as selecting a search box or an entry field in a form. Apps can then adjust their UI so that the input pane does not obscure items that the user might need to access while the input pane is shown.</summary>
