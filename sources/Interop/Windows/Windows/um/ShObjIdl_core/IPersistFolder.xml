      <para>If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.</para>

    <remarks>
      <para>All objects that implement the <see cref="IShellFolder" /> interface for use in the Shell's namespace must implement this method. When a folder's location in the namespace is not a relevant consideration, this method can simply return S_OK. When the location is relevant to the folder, you should store the fully qualified IDLIST passed in for later reference.</para>
      <para>For example, if the folder implementation needs to construct a fully qualified pointer to an item identifier list (PIDL) to elements that it contains, the PIDL passed to this method should be used to construct the fully qualified PIDLs.</para>

    <summary>
      <para>Exposes a method that initializes Shell folder objects.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>When you implement a Shell namespace extension, specifically the <see cref="IShellFolder" /> interface, you must implement this interface so the folder object can be initialized. Implementation of this interface is how the folder is told where it is in the Shell namespace.</para>
      <para>You do not use this interface directly. It is used by the file system implementation of the <see cref="IShellFolder.BindToObject" /> interface when it is initializing a Shell folder object.</para>
