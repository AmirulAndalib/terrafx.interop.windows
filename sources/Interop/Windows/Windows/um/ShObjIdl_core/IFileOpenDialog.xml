    <remarks>
      <para>This method can be used for single item or multiple item selections. If the user has entered new text in the file name field, this can be a time-consuming operation. When the application calls this method, the application parses the text in the <code>filename</code> field. For example, if this is a network share, the operation could take some time. However, this operation will not block the UI, since the user should able to stop the operation, which will result in <b>IFileOpenDialog.GetSelectedItems</b> returning a failure code).</para>
