  <member name="IExplorerPaneVisibility">
    <summary>
      <para>Used in Windows Explorer by an <see cref="IShellFolder" /> implementation to give suggestions to the view about what panes are visible. Additionally, an <see cref="IExplorerBrowser" /> host can use this interface to provide information about pane visibility. The host should implement <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/cc678966(v=vs.85)">QueryService</a> with <b>SID_ExplorerPaneVisibility</b> as the service ID. The host must be in the site chain.</para>
      <para>The <b>IExplorerPaneVisibility</b> implementation is retrieved from the Shell folder. The Shell folder, in turn, is retrieved from the view. A namespace extension can elect to provide a custom view (<see cref="IShellView" />) rather than using the system folder view object (DefView). In that case, the <b>IShellView</b> implementation must include an implementation of <see cref="IFolderView.GetFolder" /> to return the <b>IExplorerPaneVisibility</b> object.</para>
      <para>A namespace extension can provide a custom view by implementing <see cref="IShellView" /> itself rather than using the system folder view object (DefView). In that case, the <b>IShellView</b> implementation must include an implementation of <see cref="IFolderView.GetFolder" /> to make use of <b>IExplorerPaneVisibility</b> .</para>
