  <member name="IShellFolder.BindToObject">
    <summary>Retrieves a handler, typically the Shell folder object that implements <see cref="IShellFolder" /> for a particular item. Optional parameters that control the construction of the handler are passed in the bind context.</summary>
    <param name="pidl">The address of an <see cref="ITEMIDLIST" /> structure (PIDL) that identifies the subfolder. This value can refer to an item at any level below the parent folder in the namespace hierarchy. The structure contains one or more <see cref="SHITEMID" /> structures, followed by a terminating <b>NULL</b>.</param>
    <param name="pbc">
      <para>A pointer to an <see cref="IBindCtx" /> interface on a bind context object that can be used to pass parameters to the construction of the handler. If this parameter is not used, set it to <b>NULL</b>. Because support for this parameter is optional for folder object implementations, some folders may not support the use of bind contexts.</para>
      <para>Information that can be provided in the bind context includes a <see cref="BIND_OPTS" /> structure that includes a <b>grfMode</b> member that indicates the access mode when binding to a stream handler. Other parameters can be set and discovered using <see cref="IBindCtx.RegisterObjectParam" /> and <see cref="IBindCtx.GetObjectParam" />.</para>
    </param>
    <param name="riid">The identifier of the interface to return. This may be <b>IID_IShellFolder</b>, <b>IID_IStream</b>, or any other interface that identifies a particular handler.</param>
    <param name="ppv">When this method returns, contains the address of a pointer to the requested interface. If an error occurs, a <b>NULL</b> pointer is returned at this address.</param>
    <returns>If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.</returns>
  </member>
  <member name="IShellFolder.BindToStorage">
    <summary>Requests a pointer to an object's storage interface.</summary>
    <param name="pidl">The address of an <see cref="ITEMIDLIST" /> structure that identifies the subfolder relative to its parent folder. The structure must contain exactly one <see cref="SHITEMID" /> structure followed by a terminating zero.</param>
    <param name="pbc">The optional address of an <see cref="IBindCtx" /> interface on a bind context object to be used during this operation. If this parameter is not used, set it to <b>NULL</b>. Because support for <i>pbc</i> is optional for folder object implementations, some folders may not support the use of bind contexts.</param>
    <param name="riid">The IID of the requested storage interface. To retrieve an <see cref="IStream" />, <see cref="IStorage" />, or <see cref="IPropertySetStorage" /> interface pointer, set <i>riid</i> to <b>IID_IStream</b>, <b>IID_IStorage</b>, or <b>IID_IPropertySetStorage</b>, respectively.</param>
    <param name="ppv">The address that receives the interface pointer specified by <i>riid</i>. If an error occurs, a <b>NULL</b> pointer is returned in this address.</param>
    <returns>If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.</returns>

  <member name="IShellFolder.CompareIDs">
    <summary>Determines the relative order of two file objects or folders, given their item identifier lists.</summary>
    <param name="lParam">
      <para>A value that specifies how the comparison should be performed.</para>
      <para>The lower sixteen bits of <i>lParam</i> define the sorting rule. Most applications set the sorting rule to the default value of zero, indicating that the two items should be compared by name. The system does not define any other sorting rules. Some folder objects might allow calling applications to use the lower sixteen bits of <i>lParam</i> to specify folder-specific sorting rules. The rules and their associated <i>lParam</i> values are defined by the folder.</para>
      <para>When the system folder view object calls <b>IShellFolder.CompareIDs</b>, the lower sixteen bits of <i>lParam</i> are used to specify the column to be used for the comparison.</para>
      <para>The upper sixteen bits of <i>lParam</i> are used for flags that modify the sorting rule. The system currently defines these modifier flags.</para>
      <h4>SHCIDS_ALLFIELDS</h4>
      <para>
        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/bb776779(v=vs.85)">Version 5.0</a>. Compare all the information contained in the <see cref="ITEMIDLIST" /> structure, not just the display names. This flag is valid only for folder objects that support the <see cref="IShellFolder2" /> interface. For instance, if the two items are files, the folder should compare their names, sizes, file times, attributes, and any other information in the structures. If this flag is set, the lower sixteen bits of <i>lParam</i> must be zero.</para>
      <h4>SHCIDS_CANONICALONLY</h4>
      <para>
        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/bb776779(v=vs.85)">Version 5.0</a>. When comparing by name, compare the system names but not the display names. When this flag is passed, the two items are compared by whatever criteria the Shell folder determines are most efficient, as long as it implements a consistent sort function. This flag is useful when comparing for equality or when the results of the sort are not displayed to the user. This flag cannot be combined with other flags.</para>
    </param>
    <param name="pidl1">A pointer to the first item's <see cref="ITEMIDLIST" /> structure. It will be relative to the folder. This <b>ITEMIDLIST</b> structure can contain more than one element; therefore, the entire structure must be compared, not just the first element.</param>
    <param name="pidl2">A pointer to the second item's <see cref="ITEMIDLIST" /> structure. It will be relative to the folder. This <b>ITEMIDLIST</b> structure can contain more than one element; therefore, the entire structure must be compared, not just the first element.</param>

      <para>If this method is successful, the CODE field of the <b>HRESULT</b> contains one of the following values. For information regarding the extraction of the CODE field from the returned <b>HRESULT</b>, see Remarks. If this method is unsuccessful, it returns a COM error code.</para>

      <para>Optional. A pointer to a bind context used to pass parameters as inputs and outputs to the parsing function. These passed parameters are often specific to the data source and are documented by the data source owners. For example, the file system data source accepts the name being parsed (as a <see cref="WIN32_FIND_DATA" /> structure), using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/shell/str-constants">STR_FILE_SYS_BIND_DATA</a> bind context parameter. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/shell/str-constants">STR_PARSE_PREFER_FOLDER_BROWSING</a> can be passed to indicate that URLs are parsed using the file system data source when possible. Construct a bind context object using <see cref="CreateBindCtx" /> and populate the values using <see cref="IBindCtx.RegisterObjectParam" />. See <b>Bind Context String Keys</b> for a complete list of these.</para>

    <param name="pszDisplayName">
      <para>A null-terminated Unicode string with the display name. Because each Shell folder defines its own parsing syntax, the form this string can take may vary. The desktop folder, for instance, accepts paths such as "C:\My Docs\My File.txt". It also will accept references to items in the namespace that have a GUID associated with them using the ".{GUID}" syntax. For example, to retrieve a fully qualified identifier list for the control panel from the desktop folder, you can use the following:</para>
      <code>.{CLSID for Control Panel}\.{CLSID for printers folder}</code>

    <param name="pchEaten">A pointer to a <b>ULONG</b> value that receives the number of characters of the display name that was parsed. If your application does not need this information, set <i>pchEaten</i> to <b>NULL</b>, and no value will be returned.</param>

      <para>When this method returns, contains a pointer to the PIDL for the object. The returned item identifier list specifies the item relative to the parsing folder. If the object associated with <i>pszDisplayName</i> is within the parsing folder, the returned item identifier list will contain only one <see cref="SHITEMID" /> structure. If the object is in a subfolder of the parsing folder, the returned item identifier list will contain multiple <b>SHITEMID</b> structures. If an error occurs, <b>NULL</b> is returned in this address.</para>
      <para>When it is no longer needed, it is the responsibility of the caller to free this resource by calling <see cref="CoTaskMemFree" />.</para>
    </param>
    <param name="pdwAttributes">The value used to query for file attributes. If not used, it should be set to <b>NULL</b>.
