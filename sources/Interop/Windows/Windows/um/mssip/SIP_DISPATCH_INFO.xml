    <summary>
      <para>The <b>SIP_DISPATCH_INFO</b> structure contains a set of function pointers assigned by the <see cref="CryptSIPLoad" /> function that your application uses to perform <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly">subject interface package</a> (SIP) operations.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>Your application must initialize this structure to binary zeros and set <b>cbSize</b> to <code>sizeof(SIP_DISPATCH_INFO)</code> by calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/memset-wmemset">memset</a> function before calling the <see cref="CryptSIPLoad" /> function. Your application can use the function pointers in the returned <b>SIP_DISPATCH_INFO</b> structure to perform the necessary SIP operations.   The function pointers can point to functions exported by third party SIPs.</para>
