  <member name="DIBSECTION">
    <summary>The <b>DIBSECTION</b> structure contains information about a DIB created by calling the <see cref="CreateDIBSection" /> function. A <b>DIBSECTION</b> structure includes information about the bitmap's dimensions, color format, color masks, optional file mapping object, and optional bit values storage offset. An application can obtain a filled-in <b>DIBSECTION</b> structure for a given DIB by calling the <see cref="GetObject" /> function.</summary>

    <summary>A <see cref="BITMAP" /> data structure that contains information about the DIB: its type, its dimensions, its color capacities, and a pointer to its bit values.</summary>

    <summary>Specifies three color masks for the DIB. This field is only valid when the <b>BitCount</b> member of the <see cref="BITMAPINFOHEADER" /> structure has a value greater than 8. Each color mask indicates the bits that are used to encode one of the three color channels (red, green, and blue).</summary>

  <member name="DIBSECTION.dshSection">
    <summary>Contains a handle to the file mapping object that the <see cref="CreateDIBSection" /> function used to create the DIB. If <b>CreateDIBSection</b> was called with a <b>NULL</b> value for its <i>hSection</i> parameter, causing the system to allocate memory for the bitmap, the <i>dshSection</i> member will be <b>NULL</b>.</summary>

  <member name="DIBSECTION.dsOffset">
    <summary>The offset to the bitmap's bit values within the file mapping object referenced by <i>dshSection</i>. If <i>dshSection</i> is <b>NULL</b>, the <i>dsOffset</i> value has no meaning.</summary>
