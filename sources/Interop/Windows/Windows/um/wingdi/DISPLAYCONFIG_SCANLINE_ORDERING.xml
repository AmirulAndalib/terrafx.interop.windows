  <member name="DISPLAYCONFIG_SCANLINE_ORDERING">
    <summary>The DISPLAYCONFIG_SCANLINE_ORDERING enumeration specifies the method that the display uses to create an image on a screen.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DISPLAYCONFIG_SCANLINE_ORDERING.DISPLAYCONFIG_SCANLINE_ORDERING_UNSPECIFIED">
    <summary>Indicates that scan-line ordering of the output is unspecified. The caller can only set the <b>scanLineOrdering</b> member of the <see cref="DISPLAYCONFIG_PATH_TARGET_INFO" /> structure in a call to the <see cref="SetDisplayConfig" /> function to DISPLAYCONFIG_SCANLINE_ORDERING_UNSPECIFIED if the caller also set the refresh rate denominator and numerator of the <b>refreshRate</b> member both to zero. In this case, <b>SetDisplayConfig</b> uses the best refresh rate it can find.</summary>

  <member name="DISPLAYCONFIG_SCANLINE_ORDERING.DISPLAYCONFIG_SCANLINE_ORDERING_PROGRESSIVE">
    <summary>Indicates that the output is a progressive image.</summary>

  <member name="DISPLAYCONFIG_SCANLINE_ORDERING.DISPLAYCONFIG_SCANLINE_ORDERING_INTERLACED">
    <summary>Indicates that the output is an interlaced image that is created beginning with the upper field.</summary>

    <summary>Indicates that the output is an interlaced image that is created beginning with the upper field.</summary>

    <summary>Indicates that the output is an interlaced image that is created beginning with the lower field.</summary>

  <member name="DISPLAYCONFIG_SCANLINE_ORDERING.DISPLAYCONFIG_SCANLINE_ORDERING_FORCE_UINT32">
    <summary>Forces this enumeration to compile to 32 bits in size. Without this value, some compilers would allow this enumeration to compile to a size other than 32 bits. You should not use this value.</summary>
