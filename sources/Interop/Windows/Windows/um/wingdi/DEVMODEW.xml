    <summary>
      <para>The DEVMODEW structure is used for specifying characteristics of display and print devices in the Unicode (wide) character set.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows-hardware/drivers/display/the-devmodew-structure">DEVMODEW structure</a> is the Unicode version of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//previous-versions//ms535771(v=vs.85)">DEVMODE </a> structure (described in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation). While applications can use either the ANSI or Unicode version of the structure, drivers are required to use the Unicode version.</para>
      <para>For printer drivers, the DEVMODEW structure is used for specifying printer characteristics required by a print document. It is also used for specifying a printer's default characteristics.</para>
      <para>Immediately following a DEVMODEW structure's defined members (often referred to as its public members), there can be a set of driver-defined members (often referred to as private DEVMODEW members). The driver supplies the size, in bytes, of this private area in <b>dmDriverExtra</b>. Driver-defined private members are for exclusive use by the driver. The starting address for the private members can be referenced using the <b>dmSize</b> member as follows:</para>
      <code>PVOID pvDriverData = (PVOID) (((BYTE *) pdm) + (pdm-&gt;dmSize));
</code>
      <para>A driver can rely on the spooler to pass a DEVMODEW buffer that is no smaller than (<b>dmSize</b> + <b>dmDriverExtra</b>) bytes. As a result, the driver can safely read that number of bytes starting from the beginning of the buffer without causing an access violation, and without needing to probe memory.</para>
      <para>Prior to playing EMF, GDI calls the spooler to validate the contents of the public portion of the DEVMODEW buffer. If the DEVMODEW buffer does not pass the validation tests performed in the spooler, GDI does not pass the buffer on to the printer driver.</para>
      <para>
        <b>Warning</b>    Windows only confirms that the public portion of DEVMODEW is valid. However, corrupted data in the private portion of the structure can cause driver code to crash in the application or in the spooler process. Consequently, before each use of DEVMODEW data the driver should verify that the private portion of DEVMODEW is well-formed.</para>
      <para>In Windows 2000, a new <b>union</b> member was added to the DEVMODEW structure. This <b>union</b> member contains an existing DEVMODEW structure member, <b>dmDisplayFlags</b>, together with a new member, <b>dmNup</b>. This member is described in the preceding Members section.</para>
      <para>In Windows XP, a new <b>struct</b> member was added. This <b>struct</b> member contains an existing DEVMODEW structure member, <b>dmPosition</b>, together with two new members, <b>dmDisplayOrientation</b> and <b>dmDisplayFixedOutput</b>. These members are described in the preceding Members section.</para>
      <para>Also for Windows XP, several members of the DEVMODEW structure were moved to different locations in this structure. The <b>dmScale</b>, <b>dmCopies</b>, <b>dmDefaultSource</b>, and <b>dmPrintQuality</b> members were appended to the <b>struct</b> member containing the <b>dmOrientation</b>, <b>dmPaperSize</b>, <b>dmPaperLength</b>, and <b>dmPaperWidth</b> members.</para>
      <blockquote>
        <para>[!NOTE]
The wingdi.h header defines DEVMODE as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes">Conventions for Function Prototypes</a>.</para>
