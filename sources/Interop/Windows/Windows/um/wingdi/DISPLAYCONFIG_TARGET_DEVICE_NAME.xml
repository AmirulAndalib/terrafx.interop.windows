    <remarks>
      <para>Extended display identification data (EDID) is a set of data that is provided by a display to describe its capabilities to a graphics adapter. EDID data allows a computer to detect the type of monitor that is connected to it. EDID data includes the manufacturer name, the product type, the timings that are supported by the display, the display size, as well as other display characteristics. EDID is defined by a standard published by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA).</para>
      <para>A named device object has a path and name of the form <i>\Device\DeviceName</i>. This is known as the <i>device name</i> of the device object.</para>
      <para>If an application calls the <see cref="DisplayConfigGetDeviceInfo" /> function to obtain the monitor name and <b>DisplayConfigGetDeviceInfo</b> either cannot get the monitor name or the target is forced without a monitor connected, the string in the <b>monitorFriendlyDeviceName</b> member of the DISPLAYCONFIG_TARGET_DEVICE_NAME structure is a <b>NULL</b> string and none of the bit-field flags in the <see cref="DISPLAYCONFIG_TARGET_DEVICE_NAME_FLAGS" /> structure are set.</para>

      <para>A <see cref="DISPLAYCONFIG_DEVICE_INFO_HEADER" /> structure that contains information about the request for the target device name. The caller should set the <b>type</b> member of DISPLAYCONFIG_DEVICE_INFO_HEADER to DISPLAYCONFIG_DEVICE_INFO_GET_TARGET_NAME and the <b>adapterId</b> and <b>id</b> members of DISPLAYCONFIG_DEVICE_INFO_HEADER to the target for which the caller wants the target device name.
