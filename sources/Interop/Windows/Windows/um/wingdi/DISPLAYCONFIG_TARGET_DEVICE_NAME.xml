  <member name="DISPLAYCONFIG_TARGET_DEVICE_NAME.header">
    <summary>A <see cref="DISPLAYCONFIG_DEVICE_INFO_HEADER" /> structure that contains information about the request for the target device name. The caller should set the <b>type</b> member of DISPLAYCONFIG_DEVICE_INFO_HEADER to DISPLAYCONFIG_DEVICE_INFO_GET_TARGET_NAME and the <b>adapterId</b> and <b>id</b> members of DISPLAYCONFIG_DEVICE_INFO_HEADER to the target for which the caller wants the target device name. The caller should set the <b>size</b> member of DISPLAYCONFIG_DEVICE_INFO_HEADER to at least the size of the DISPLAYCONFIG_TARGET_DEVICE_NAME structure.</summary>
