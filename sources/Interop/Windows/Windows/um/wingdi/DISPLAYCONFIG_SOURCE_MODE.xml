    <summary>
      <para>The <b>DISPLAYCONFIG_SOURCE_MODE</b> structure represents a point or an offset in a two-dimensional space.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>The arrangement of source surfaces on the desktop is controlled by the <b>position</b> member, which specifies the position in desktop coordinates of the upper-left corner of the source surface. The source surface that is positioned at (0, 0) is considered the primary. GDI has strict rules about how the source surfaces can be arranged in the desktop space. For example, there cannot be any gaps between source surfaces, and there can be no overlaps.</para>
      <para>The <see cref="SetDisplayConfig" /> function attempts to rearrange source surfaces in order to enforce these layout rules. The caller must make every effort to lay out the source surfaces correctly because  GDI  rearranges the sources in an undefined manner to enforce the layout rules. The resultant layout may not be what the caller wanted to achieve.</para>
