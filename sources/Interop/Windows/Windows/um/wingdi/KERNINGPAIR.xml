  <member name="KERNINGPAIR.iKernAmount">
    <summary>The amount this pair will be kerned if they appear side by side in the same font and size. This value is typically negative, because pair kerning usually results in two characters being set more tightly than normal. The value is specified in logical units; that is, it depends on the current mapping mode.</summary>
