      <para>The <b>TTPOLYCURVE</b> structure contains information about a curve in the outline of a TrueType character.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>When an application calls the <see cref="GetGlyphOutline" /> function, a glyph outline for a TrueType character is returned in a <see cref="TTPOLYGONHEADER" /> structure, followed by as many <b>TTPOLYCURVE</b> structures as are required to describe the glyph. All points are returned as <see cref="POINTFX" /> structures and represent absolute positions, not relative moves. The starting point specified by the <b>pfxStart</b> member of the <b>TTPOLYGONHEADER</b> structure is the point at which the outline for a contour begins. The <b>TTPOLYCURVE</b> structures that follow can be either polyline records or spline records.</para>
      <para>Polyline records are a series of points; lines drawn between the points describe the outline of the character. Spline records represent the quadratic curves (that is, quadratic b-splines) used by TrueType.</para>
