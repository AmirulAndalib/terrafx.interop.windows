      <para>The current journal identifier. A journal is assigned a new identifier on creation and can be stamped with
a new identifier in the course of its existence. The NTFS file system uses this identifier for an integrity
check.</para>

    <summary>
      <para>The first record that was written into the journal for this journal instance. Enumerating the files or
directories on a volume can return a USN lower than this value (in other words, a
<b>FirstUsn</b> member value less than the <b>LowestValidUsn</b> member
value). If it does, the journal has been stamped with a new identifier since the last USN was written. In this
case, <b>LowestValidUsn</b> may indicate a discontinuity in the journal, in which changes to
some or all files or directories on the volume may have occurred that are not recorded in the change
journal.</para>
