      <para>Used in conjunction with the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/api/winioctl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_storage_query_property">IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY</a> control code
to retrieve the storage device descriptor data for a device.</para>

    <remarks>
      <para>An application can determine the required buffer size by issuing a
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/api/winioctl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_storage_query_property">IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY</a> control code
passing a <see cref="STORAGE_DESCRIPTOR_HEADER" /> structure
for the output buffer, and then using the returned <b>Size</b> member of the
<b>STORAGE_DESCRIPTOR_HEADER</b> structure to allocate
a buffer of the proper size.</para>

  <member name="STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR.Size">
    <summary>
      <para>Specifies the total size of the descriptor, in bytes, which may include vendor ID, product ID, product
revision, device serial number strings and bus-specific data which are appended to the structure.</para>

  <member name="STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR.CommandQueueing">
    <summary>
      <para>Indicates when <b>TRUE</b> that the device supports multiple outstanding commands (SCSI
tagged queuing or equivalent). When <b>FALSE</b>, the device does not support SCSI-tagged
queuing or the equivalent.</para>
