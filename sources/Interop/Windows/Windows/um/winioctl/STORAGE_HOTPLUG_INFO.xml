      <para>Provides information about the hotplug information of a device.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>The value of the <b>Size</b> member also identifies the version of this structure, as
members will be added to this structure in the future. If the value of the <b>Size</b> member
is <code>sizeof(STORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO)</code>, the current version of the
structure is the same as the version you compiled with. If the value is not
<code>sizeof(STORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO)</code>, then the current version contains
additional members.</para>
      <para>A hotplug device refers to a device whose <b>RemovalPolicy</b> value displayed in
the Device Manager is <b>ExpectSurpriseRemoval</b>. To query whether a particular device is a
hotplug device, use the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/api/winioctl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_storage_get_hotplug_info">IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_HOTPLUG_INFO</a> operation.
To set the hotplug properties of a device, use the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/api/winioctl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_storage_set_hotplug_info">IOCTL_STORAGE_SET_HOTPLUG_INFO</a></para>

      <para>The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/api/winioctl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_storage_set_hotplug_info">IOCTL_STORAGE_SET_HOTPLUG_INFO</a></para>
      <para>operation only sets the value of the <b>DeviceHotplug</b> member of this structure. If the
value of that member is set, the removal policy of the specified device is set to
<b>ExpectSurpriseRemoval</b> and all levels of caching are disabled. If the value of that
member is not set, the removal policy of the specified device is set
to <b>ExpectOrderlyRemoval</b>, and caching may be selectively enabled.</para>
