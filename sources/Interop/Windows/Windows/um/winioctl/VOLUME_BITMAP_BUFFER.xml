  <member name="VOLUME_BITMAP_BUFFER.Buffer">
    <summary>Array of bytes containing the bitmap that the operation returns. The bitmap is bitwise from bit zero of the bitmap to the end. Thus, starting at the requested cluster, the bitmap goes from bit 0 of byte 0, bit 1 of byte 0 ... bit 7 of byte 0, bit 0 of byte 1, and so on. The value 1 indicates that the cluster is allocated (in use). The value 0 indicates that the cluster is not allocated (free).</summary>
