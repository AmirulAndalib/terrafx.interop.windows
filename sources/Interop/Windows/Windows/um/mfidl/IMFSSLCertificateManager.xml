    <summary>
      <para>Implemented by a client and called by Microsoft Media Foundation to get the client Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate requested by the server.</para>
      <para>In most HTTPS connections the server provides a certificate so that the client can ensure the identity of the server. However, in certain cases the server might wants to verify the identity of the client by requesting the client to send a certificate. For this scenario,  a client application must provide a mechanism for Media Foundation to retrieve the client side certificate while opening an HTTPS URL with the source resolver or the scheme handler. The application must implement <b>IMFSSLCertificateManager</b>, set the <b>IUnknown</b> pointer of the implemented object in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/medfound/mfnetsource-sslcertificate-manager">MFNETSOURCE_SSLCERTIFICATE_MANAGER</a> property, and pass the property store to the source resolver. While opening the URL, Media Foundation calls the <b>IMFSSLCertificateManager</b> methods to get the certificate information. If the application needs to connect to HTTPS URL that requires a client-side certificate, or the application  wants customized control over the type of server certificates to accept, then they can implement this interface. This interface can also be used by the application to validate the server SSL certificate.</para>
      <para>If the <b>IUnknown</b> pointer is not provided by the application and the HTTPS URL does not require the client to provide a certificate,
Media Foundation uses the default implementation to open the URL.</para>
