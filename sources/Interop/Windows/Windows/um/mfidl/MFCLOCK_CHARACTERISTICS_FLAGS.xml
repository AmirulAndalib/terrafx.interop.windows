    <summary>The clock times returned by the <see cref="IMFClock.GetCorrelatedTime" /> method are in units of 100 nanoseconds. If this flag is absent, call <see cref="IMFClock.GetProperties" /> to get the clock frequency. The clock frequency is given in the <b>qwClockFrequency</b> member of the <see cref="MFCLOCK_PROPERTIES" /> structure returned by that method.</summary>
