      <para>Contains flags for the <see cref="IMFQualityAdvise2.NotifyQualityEvent" /> method.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>If the decoder sets the <b>MF_QUALITY_CANNOT_KEEP_UP</b> flag, the quality manager tries to reduce latency through the media source and the media sink. For example, it might request the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/medfound/enhanced-video-renderer">Enhanced Video Renderer</a> (EVR) to drop frames. During this period, the quality manager stops calling the decoder's <see cref="IMFQualityAdvise2.NotifyQualityEvent" /> method, until samples are no longer arriving late at the sink. At that point, the quality manager resumes calling <b>NotifyQualityEvent</b> on the decoder.</para>
