    <summary>
      <para>Defines the profile flags that are set in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/medfound/mf-transcode-adjust-profile">MF_TRANSCODE_ADJUST_PROFILE</a> attribute.</para>
      <para>These flags are checked by <see cref="MFCreateTranscodeTopology" /> during topology building. Based on these flags, <b>MFCreateTranscodeTopology</b> adjusts the transcode profile by modifying the configuration settings for the streams according to the input requirements of the encoder used in the topology.</para>
      <para>For more information about the stream settings that an application can specify, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/medfound/fast-transcode-objects">Using the Transcode API</a>.</para>

    <summary>Media Foundation uses the application-specified settings for audio and video streams. If the required settings are not provided by the application, the topology is created but the encoding session fails. For the video stream, the frame rate and the interlace mode settings are modified. For more information, see Remarks.</summary>

    <summary>For both audio and video streams, the missing stream settings are filled by copying the input source attributes. This flag ensures the transcoded output file is the closest match to the input file.</summary>
