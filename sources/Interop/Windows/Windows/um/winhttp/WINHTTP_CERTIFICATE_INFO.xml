    <summary>
      <para>The <b>WINHTTP_CERTIFICATE_INFO</b> structure contains certificate information returned from the server. This structure is used by the
<see cref="WinHttpQueryOption" /> function.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>The <b>WINHTTP_CERTIFICATE_INFO</b> structure contains information on the certificate returned by the server when the connection uses SSL/TLS. The <see cref="WinHttpQueryOption" /> function returns the <b>WINHTTP_CERTIFICATE_INFO</b> structure when the <i>dwOption</i> parameter passed to the <b>WinHttpQueryOption</b> function is set to <b>WINHTTP_OPTION_SECURITY_CERTIFICATE_STRUCT</b>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/WinHttp/option-flags">Option Flags</a>.</para>
      <para>The <see cref="WinHttpQueryOption" /> function does not set  the <b>lpszProtocolName</b>, <b>lpszSignatureAlgName</b>, and <b>lpszEncryptionAlgName</b> members of the <b>WINHTTP_CERTIFICATE_INFO</b> structure, so these member are always returned as <b>NULL</b>.</para>
      <para>Once the application no longer needs the returned <b>WINHTTP_CERTIFICATE_INFO</b> structure, the  <see cref="LocalFree" /> function should be called to free any pointers returned in the structure. The structure members containing pointers that are not NULL and need to be freed are <b>lpszSubjectInfo</b> and <b>lpszIssuerInfo</b>.</para>
