      <para>Flags that control the file operation. This member can take a combination of the following flags.</para>
      <h4>FOF_ALLOWUNDO</h4>
      <para>Preserve undo information, if possible.</para>
      <para>Prior to Windows Vista, operations could be undone only from the same process that performed the original operation.</para>
      <para>In Windows Vista and later systems, the scope of the undo is a user session. Any process running in the user session can undo another operation. The undo state is held in the Explorer.exe process, and as long as that process is running, it can coordinate the undo functions.</para>
      <para>If the source file parameter does not contain fully qualified path and file names, this flag is ignored.</para>
      <h4>FOF_CONFIRMMOUSE</h4>
      <para>Not used.</para>
      <h4>FOF_FILESONLY</h4>
      <para>Perform the operation only on files (not on folders) if a wildcard file name (<i>.</i>) is specified.</para>
      <h4>FOF_MULTIDESTFILES</h4>
      <para>The <b>pTo</b> member specifies multiple destination files (one for each source file in <b>pFrom</b>) rather than one directory where all source files are to be deposited.</para>
      <h4>FOF_NOCONFIRMATION</h4>
      <para>Respond with <b>Yes to All</b> for any dialog box that is displayed.</para>
      <h4>FOF_NOCONFIRMMKDIR</h4>
      <para>Do not ask the user to confirm the creation of a new directory if the operation requires one to be created.</para>
      <h4>FOF_NO_CONNECTED_ELEMENTS</h4>
      <para>
        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/bb776779(v=vs.85)">Version 5.0.</a> Do not move connected files as a group. Only move the specified files.</para>

      <para>
        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/bb776779(v=vs.85)">Version 4.71.</a> Do not copy the security attributes of the file. The destination file receives the security attributes of its new folder.</para>
      <h4>FOF_NOERRORUI</h4>
      <para>Do not display a dialog to the user if an error occurs.</para>
      <h4>FOF_NORECURSEREPARSE</h4>
      <para>Not used.</para>

      <para>
        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/bb776779(v=vs.85)">Windows Vista</a>. Perform the operation silently, presenting no UI to the user. This is equivalent to FOF_SILENT | FOF_NOCONFIRMATION | FOF_NOERRORUI | FOF_NOCONFIRMMKDIR.</para>
      <h4>FOF_RENAMEONCOLLISION</h4>
      <para>Give the file being operated on a new name in a move, copy, or rename operation if a file with the target name already exists at the destination.</para>
      <h4>FOF_SILENT</h4>
      <para>Do not display a progress dialog box.</para>
      <h4>FOF_SIMPLEPROGRESS</h4>
      <para>Display a progress dialog box but do not show individual file names as they are operated on.</para>
      <h4>FOF_WANTMAPPINGHANDLE</h4>
      <para>If <b>FOF_RENAMEONCOLLISION</b> is specified and any files were renamed, assign a name mapping object that contains their old and new names to the <b>hNameMappings</b> member. This object must be freed using <see cref="SHFreeNameMappings" /> when it is no longer needed.</para>
