  <member name="SHFILEOPSTRUCT - SHFILEOPSTRUCTW">
    <summary>
      <para>Contains information that the <see cref="SHFileOperation" /> function uses to perform file operations.</para>
      <para>
        <b>Note</b>  As of Windows Vista, the use of the <see cref="IFileOperation" /> interface is recommended over this function.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>
        <b>Important</b>  You must ensure that the source and destination paths are double-null terminated. A normal string ends in just a single null character. If you pass that value in either the source or destination members, the function will not realize when it has reached the end of the string and will continue to read on in memory until it comes to a random double null value. This can at least lead to a buffer overrun, and possibly the unintended deletion of unrelated data.</para>
      <code>// WRONG
LPTSTR pszSource = L"C:\\Windows\\*";

// RIGHT
LPTSTR pszSource = L"C:\\Windows\\*\0";

</code>
      <para>To account for the two terminating null characters, be sure to create buffers large enough to hold MAX_PATH (which normally includes the single terminating null character) plus 1.</para>
      <para>It cannot be overstated that your paths should always be full paths. If the <b>pFrom</b> or <b>pTo</b> members are unqualified names, the current directories are taken from the global current drive and directory settings as managed by the <see cref="GetCurrentDirectory" /> and <see cref="SetCurrentDirectory" /> functions.</para>
      <para>If you do not provide a full path, the following facts become pertinent:</para>
      <list type="bullet">
        <item>
          <description>The lack of a path before a file name does not indicate to <see cref="SHFileOperation" /> that this file resides in the root of the current directory.</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>The PATH environment variable is not used by <see cref="SHFileOperation" /> to determine a valid path.</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>
            <see cref="SHFileOperation" /> cannot be relied on to use the directory that is the current directory when it begins executing. The directory seen as the current directory is process-wide, and it can be changed from another thread while the operation is executing. If that were to happen, the results of <b>SHFileOperation</b> would be unpredictable.</description>
        </item>
      </list>
      <para>If <b>pFrom</b> is set to a file name without a full path, deleting the file with <b>FO_DELETE</b> does not move it to the Recycle Bin, even if the <b>FOF_ALLOWUNDO</b> flag is set. You must provide a full path to delete the file to the Recycle Bin.</para>
      <para>
        <see cref="SHFileOperation" /> fails on any path prefixed with "\?".</para>
      <para>There are two versions of this structure, an ANSI version (SHFILEOPSTRUCTA) and a Unicode version (SHFILEOPSTRUCTW). The Unicode version is identical to the ANSI version, except that wide character strings (<b>LPCWSTR</b>) are used in place of ANSI character strings (<b>LPCSTR</b>). On Windows 98 and earlier, only the ANSI version is supported. On Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 and later, both the ANSI and Unicode versions of this structure are supported. SHFILEOPSTRUCTW and SHFILEOPTSTRUCTA should never be used directly; the appropriate structure is redefined as <b>SHFILEOPSTRUCT</b> by the precompiler depending on whether the application is compiled for ANSI or Unicode.</para>
      <para>
        <see cref="SHNAMEMAPPING" /> has similar ANSI and Unicode versions. For ANSI applications, <b>hNameMappings</b> points to an <b>int</b> followed by an array of ANSI <b>SHNAMEMAPPING</b> structures. For Unicode applications, <b>hNameMappings</b> points to an <b>int</b> followed by an array of Unicode <b>SHNAMEMAPPING</b> structures. However, on Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 and later, <see cref="SHFileOperation" /><i>always</i> returns a handle to a Unicode set of <b>SHNAMEMAPPING</b> structures. If you want applications to be functional with all versions of Windows, the application must employ conditional code to deal with name mappings. For example:</para>
      <code>x = SHFileOperation(&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;shop);

if (fWin9x)
    HandleAnsiNameMappings(shop.hNameMappings);
else
    HandleUnicodeNameMappings(shop.hNameMappings);

</code>
      <para>Treat <b>hNameMappings</b> as a pointer to a structure whose members are a <b>UINT</b> value followed by a pointer to an array of <see cref="SHNAMEMAPPING" /> structures, as seen in its declaration:</para>
      <code>struct HANDLETOMAPPINGS
{
    UINT              uNumberOfMappings;  // Number of mappings in the array.
    LPSHNAMEMAPPING   lpSHNameMapping;    // Pointer to the array of mappings.
};

</code>
      <para>The <b>UINT</b> value indicates the number of <see cref="SHNAMEMAPPING" /> structures in the array. Each <b>SHNAMEMAPPING</b> structure contains the old and new path for one of the renamed files.</para>
      <para>
        <b>Note</b>  The handle must be freed with <see cref="SHFreeNameMappings" />.</para>
      <blockquote>
        <para>[!NOTE]
The shellapi.h header defines SHFILEOPSTRUCT as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes">Conventions for Function Prototypes</a>.</para>
