  <member name="QUERY_USER_NOTIFICATION_STATE.QUNS_QUIET_TIME">
    <summary>
      <para>
        <b>Introduced in Windows 7</b>. The current user is in "quiet time", which is the first hour after a new user logs into his or her account for the first time. During this time, most notifications should not be sent or shown. This lets a user become accustomed to a new computer system without those distractions. Quiet time also occurs for each user after an operating system upgrade or clean installation.</para>
      <para>Applications should set the <see cref="NIIF_RESPECT_QUIET_TIME" /> flag in their notifications or balloon tooltip, which prevents those items from being displayed while the current user is in the quiet-time state.</para>
      <para>Note that during quiet time, if the user is in one of the other blocked modes (QUNS_NOT_PRESENT, QUNS_BUSY, QUNS_PRESENTATION_MODE, or QUNS_RUNNING_D3D_FULL_SCREEN) <see cref="SHQueryUserNotificationState" /> returns only that value, and does not report QUNS_QUIET_TIME.</para>
