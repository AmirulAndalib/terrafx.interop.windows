Do not display the balloon notification if the current user is in "quiet time", which is the first hour after a new user logs into his or her account for the first time. During this time, most notifications should not be sent or shown. This lets a user become accustomed to a new computer system without those distractions. Quiet time also occurs for each user after an operating system upgrade or clean installation. A notification sent with this flag during quiet time is not queued; it is simply dismissed unshown. The application can resend the notification later if it is still valid at that time.</para>
      <para>Because an application cannot predict when it might encounter quiet time, we recommended that this flag always be set on all appropriate notifications by any application that means to honor quiet time.</para>
