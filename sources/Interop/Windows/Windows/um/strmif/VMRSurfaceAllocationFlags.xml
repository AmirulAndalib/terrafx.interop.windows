    <summary>
      <para>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a> and <see cref="IMFMediaEngine" />. <b>MediaPlayer</b> and <b>IMFMediaEngine</b> have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <b>MediaPlayer</b> and <b>IMFMediaEngine</b> instead of <b>DirectShow</b>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</para>
      <para>The <b>VMRSurfaceAllocationFlags</b> enumeration is used with the <see cref="IVMRSurfaceAllocator.AllocateSurface" /> method to specify surface creation parameters.</para>

  <member name="VMRSurfaceAllocationFlags.AMAP_PIXELFORMAT_VALID">
    <summary>Indicates that the <b>lpPxFmt</b> field contains valid data that should be used to create the DirectDraw surface.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="VMRSurfaceAllocationFlags.AMAP_3D_TARGET">
    <summary>Indicates that the DirectDraw surface created should also be a Direct3D render target that is created with the <b>DDSCAPS_3DDEVICE</b> flag set.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="VMRSurfaceAllocationFlags.AMAP_ALLOW_SYSMEM">
    <summary>Indicates that if you can't allocate the DirectDraw surface in video memory you will try to allocate a system memory DirectDraw surface. (Note you should never allocate an AGP memory surface.)</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="VMRSurfaceAllocationFlags.AMAP_FORCE_SYSMEM">
    <summary>Force the surface to be created in system memory. Specify this if you will use GDI to process the image before it is rendered. The surface must match the current monitor display format (pixel depth).</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="VMRSurfaceAllocationFlags.AMAP_DIRECTED_FLIP">
    <summary>Means that when Flip is called you should Flip to the specified DirectDraw Surface passed as a parameter to the <see cref="PresentImage" /> method in the <see cref="IVMRImagePresenter" /> interface. Correct support for this flag is crucial in order to keep DXVA buffers seen by a video decoder in sync with the DXVA buffers seen by the graphics driver.</summary>

  <member name="VMRSurfaceAllocationFlags.AMAP_DXVA_TARGET">
    <summary>Indicates that this surface will be used as a DXVA target.</summary>
