      <para>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <see cref="IMFMediaEngine" />, and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <b>MediaPlayer</b>, <b>IMFMediaEngine</b> and <b>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</b> instead of <b>DirectShow</b>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</para>
      <para>The <code>UnableToRender</code> method is called by the Filter Graph Manager if it cannot find any combination of filters to render the specified pin.</para>
    </summary>
    <param name="pPin">Specifies the <see cref="IPin" /> interface of the pin that could not be rendered.</param>
    <returns>If the return value is S_OK, this Filter Graph Manager attempts to render the pin again. For any other return value, including S_FALSE and other success codes, the Filter Graph Manager continues to build the graph as normal. Typically it will reject the current filter and attempt to use a different filter.</returns>

      <para>The <code>IAMFilterGraphCallback</code> interface provides a callback mechanism during graph building.</para>
      <para>To use this interface, implement the interface in your application or client object. Query the Filter Graph Manager for the <b>IObjectWithSite</b> interface and call the <b>IObjectWithSite.SetSite</b> method with a pointer to your implementation of the interface. During graph building, if the Filter Graph Manager fails to render a pin, it calls the <b>UnabletoRender</b> method. The client can then take appropriate action, such as providing an error message for the user or registering a new filter.</para>
