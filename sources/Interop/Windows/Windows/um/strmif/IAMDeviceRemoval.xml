      <para>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature.

Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <b>MediaPlayer</b>, <b>IMFMediaEngine</b> and <b>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</b> instead of <b>DirectShow</b>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</para>
      <para>The <code>DeviceInfo</code> method retrieves information about the device.</para>

    <param name="pclsidInterfaceClass">Receives a GUID that specifies the device interface class.</param>
    <param name="pwszSymbolicLink">Receives a pointer to a string that contains the Plug and Play (PnP) device path for the device. The caller must release the string by calling <see cref="CoTaskMemFree" />. This parameter can be <b>NULL</b>.</param>
    <returns>If the method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.</returns>

      <para>The <code>IAMDeviceRemoval</code> interface provides a way for the Filter Graph Manager to register for device removal events for a capture device. The KsProxy filter exposes this interface. (See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/DirectShow/wdm-video-capture-filter">WDM Video Capture Filter</a>.)</para>
      <para>Applications typically do not use this interface, and third-party filters do not need to implement this interface. To get a pointer to this interface, call <b>QueryInterface</b> on the KsProxy filter.</para>
