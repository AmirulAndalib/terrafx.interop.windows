      <para>The <code>IVMRSurfaceAllocatorNotify</code> interface is implemented by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/DirectShow/video-mixing-renderer-filter-7">Video Mixing Renderer Filter 7</a> (VMR-7). Applications use this interface to set a custom allocator-presenter and the allocator-presenter uses this interface to inform the VMR-7 of changes to the system environment that affect the DirectDraw surfaces.</para>
      <para>In order for an application to obtain this interface, the VMR must be in renderless mode.</para>
      <para>For the VMR-9, use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/vmr9/nn-vmr9-ivmrsurfaceallocatornotify9">IVMRSurfaceAllocatorNotify9</a> interface.</para>
