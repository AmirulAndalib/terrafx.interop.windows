      <para>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <see cref="IMFMediaEngine" />, and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <b>MediaPlayer</b>, <b>IMFMediaEngine</b> and <b>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</b> instead of <b>DirectShow</b>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</para>
