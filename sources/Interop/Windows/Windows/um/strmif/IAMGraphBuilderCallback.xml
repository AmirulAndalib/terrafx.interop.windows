    <remarks>
      <para>This method enables the client to configure the filter immediately after it has been created. The Video Mixing Renderer is the primary example of a filter that requires configuration before it is connected. Most other DirectShow filters can be configured after they are connected.</para>
      <para>The Filter Graph Manager holds a graph-wide critical section while it calls this method. Therefore, the callback method should avoid calling any methods on the Filter Graph Manager, or any methods on filters that might change the graph state (such as disconnecting pins). Doing so might cause a deadlock or other unexpected behaviors.</para>

    <summary>
      <para>The <code>IAMGraphBuilderCallback</code> interface provides a callback mechanism during graph building.</para>
      <para>To use this interface, implement the interface in your application or client object. Query the Filter Graph Manager for the <b>IObjectWithSite</b> interface and call the <b>IObjectWithSite.SetSite</b> method with a pointer to your implementation of the interface. The Filter Graph Manager calls the methods on this interface while it builds the graph, which gives the client the opportunity to modify the graph-building process.</para>
      <para>The primary use for this interface is to configure the Video Mixing Renderer filter before it is connected. You can also use it reject a specific filter during graph building, such as a decoder filter.</para>
