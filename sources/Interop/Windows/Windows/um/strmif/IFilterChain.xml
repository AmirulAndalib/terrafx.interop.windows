      <para>The <code>IFilterChain</code> interface provides methods for starting, stopping, or removing chains of filters in a filter graph. The filter graph manager exposes this interface.</para>
      <para>A <i>filter chain</i> is a sequence of filters, each with at most one connected input pin and one connected output pin, that forms an unbroken line of filters. A filter chain is defined by the filter at the start of the chain and the filter at the end of the chain. (These can be the same filter, making a chain of one filter.) By definition, there is a single stream path going from the start of the chain downstream to the end of the chain.</para>
      <para>The methods on this interface are useful in situations where an entire stream of data can appear or disappear, such as a video conferencing application that receives multiple streams over a network. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/DirectShow/dynamic-graph-building">Dynamic Graph Building</a>. To control individual streams on a capture filter, use the <see cref="IAMStreamControl" /> interface instead.</para>
