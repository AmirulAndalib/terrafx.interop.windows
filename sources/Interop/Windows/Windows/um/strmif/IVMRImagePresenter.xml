      <para>The <code>IVMRImagePresenter</code> interface is implemented by the default Allocator-Presenter for the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/DirectShow/video-mixing-renderer-filter-7">Video Mixing Renderer Filter 7</a> (VMR-7). It must also be implemented by any plug-in Allocator-Presenter that an application provides for the VMR-7. The VMR-7 uses the methods on this interface to inform the Allocator-Presenter that it should present the video frame contained in the supplied Direct Draw surface. Applications do not use this interface.</para>
      <para>For the VMR-9, use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/vmr9/nn-vmr9-ivmrimagepresenter9">IVMRImagePresenter9</a> interface.</para>
