      <para>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature.

Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <b>MediaPlayer</b>, <b>IMFMediaEngine</b> and <b>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</b> instead of <b>DirectShow</b>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</para>

      <para>The <code>IStreamBuilder</code> interface enables an output pin to notify the filter graph manager that the pin itself will build the downstream section of the filter graph. Output pins with special connection needs can implement this interface to override the default pin connection process used by the filter graph manager.</para>
