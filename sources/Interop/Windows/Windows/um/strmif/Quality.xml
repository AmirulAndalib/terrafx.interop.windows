  <member name="Quality.Proportion">
    <summary>
      <para>Value that specifies the rate at which DirectShow should continue to send media samples. The base value is 1000, which indicates there should be no change. A percentage increase or decrease from 1000 indicates the percentage of frames to add or drop. If this value is 800, for example, DirectShow will drop 20 percent of the incoming frames to match the renderer's speed.</para>
