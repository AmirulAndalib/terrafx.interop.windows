    <summary>
      <para>The <code>NotifyRelease</code> method is called whenever the allocator's <see cref="IMemAllocator.ReleaseBuffer" /> method is called. The <b>ReleaseBuffer</b> method returns a media sample to the allocator's free list. Samples call this method when their reference counts reach zero.</para>
    </summary>
    <returns>
      <para>Return S_OK or an error code.</para>
    </returns>
    <remarks>
      <para>In general, this call can occur on any thread, and the caller may be holding critical sections. Therefore, this method should not do anything that could cause a deadlock. Instead, the method should set an event or post a message to another thread, and the other thread should take any required actions.</para>
