      <para>The <code>IAMLatency</code> interface reports the amount of latency that a filter introduces into the graph. Latency is defined as the time that it takes the filter to process a sample. For a source filter, latency is the filter's maximum buffer size, measured in time. For example, a video capture filter that buffers one frame at 30 frames per second introduces a latency of about 33 milliseconds.</para>
      <para>Currently, there is no support for using this interface by itself. A source filter that streams live or real-time data should implement the <see cref="IAMPushSource" /> interface, which inherits from this interface.</para>
