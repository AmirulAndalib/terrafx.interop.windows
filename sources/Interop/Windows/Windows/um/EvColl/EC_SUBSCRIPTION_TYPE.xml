  <member name="EC_SUBSCRIPTION_TYPE.EcSubscriptionTypeSourceInitiated">
    <summary>Allows you to define an event subscription on an event collector computer without defining the event source computers. Multiple remote event source computers can then be set up (using a group policy setting) to forward events to the event collector computer. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/WEC/setting-up-a-source-initiated-subscription">Setting up a Source Initiated Subscription</a>. This subscription type is useful when you do not know or you do not want to specify all the event sources computers that will forward events.</summary>
