    <summary>
      <para>The <b>IP_ADAPTER_ORDER_MAP</b> structure stores an array of information about adapters and their relative priority on the local computer.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>This structure is returned by the GetAdapterOrderMap function, and is used as a tie breaker for otherwise equal interfaces during network operations. The GetAdapterOrderMap function should not be called directly; use the GetAdaptersInfo function instead.</para>
      <para>The <b>IP_ADAPTER_ORDER_MAP</b> structure contains at least one <b>AdapterOrder</b> member even if the <b>NumAdapters</b> member of the <b>IP_ADAPTER_ORDER_MAP</b> structure indicates no network adapters. When the <b>NumAdapters</b> member of the <b>IP_ADAPTER_ORDER_MAP</b> structure is zero, the value of the single  <b>AdapterOrder</b> member is undefined.</para>
      <para>This structure is defined in the <i>Ipexport.h</i> header file which is automatically included in the <i>Iphlpapi.h</i> header file. The <i>Ipexport.h</i> header file should never be used directly.</para>
