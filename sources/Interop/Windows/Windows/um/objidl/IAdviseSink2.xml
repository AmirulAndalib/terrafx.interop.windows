    <summary>Notifies the container that registered the advise sink that a link source has changed (either name or location), enabling the container to update the link's moniker.</summary>

  <member name="IAdviseSink2">
    <summary>The <b>IAdviseSink2</b> interface is an extension of the <see cref="IAdviseSink" /> interface, adding the method <see cref="OnLinkSrcChange" /> to the contract to handle a change in the moniker of a linked object. This avoids overloading the implementation <see cref="IAdviseSink.OnRename" /> to handle the renaming of both embedded objects and linked objects. In applications where different blocks of code might execute depending on which of these two similar events has occurred, using the same method for both events complicates testing and debugging.</summary>
