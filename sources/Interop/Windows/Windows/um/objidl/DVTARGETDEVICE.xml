  <member name="DVTARGETDEVICE.tdSize">
    <summary>The size, in bytes, of the <b>DVTARGETDEVICE</b> structure. The initial size is included so the structure can be copied more easily.</summary>

  <member name="DVTARGETDEVICE.tdDriverNameOffset">
    <summary>The offset, in bytes, from the beginning of the structure to the device driver name, which is stored as a NULL-terminated string in the <b>tdData</b> buffer.</summary>

  <member name="DVTARGETDEVICE.tdDeviceNameOffset">
    <summary>The offset, in bytes, from the beginning of the structure to the device name, which is stored as a NULL-terminated string in the <b>tdData</b> buffer. This value can be zero to indicate no device name.</summary>

  <member name="DVTARGETDEVICE.tdData">
    <summary>An array of bytes containing data for the target device. It is not necessary to include empty strings in <b>tdData</b> (for names where the offset value is zero).</summary>
