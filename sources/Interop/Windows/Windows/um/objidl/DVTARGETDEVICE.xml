  <member name="DVTARGETDEVICE">
    <summary>
      <para>Specifies information about the target device for which data is being composed. <b>DVTARGETDEVICE</b> contains enough information about a Windows target device so a handle to a device context (<b>HDC</b>) can be created using the <see cref="CreateDC" /> function.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>Some OLE 1 client applications incorrectly construct target devices by allocating too few bytes in the <see cref="DEVMODE" /> structure for the <b>DVTARGETDEVICE</b>. They typically only supply the number of bytes in the <b>dmSize</b> member of <b>DEVMODE</b>. The number of bytes to be allocated should be the sum of <b>dmSize</b> + <b>dmDriverExtra</b>. When a call is made to the <see cref="CreateDC" /> function with an incorrect target device, the printer driver tries to access the additional bytes and unpredictable results can occur. To help protect against a crash and make the additional bytes available, OLE pads the size of OLE 2 target devices created from OLE 1 target devices.</para>
