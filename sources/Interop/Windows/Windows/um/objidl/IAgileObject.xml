    <summary>
      <para>Marks an interface as agile across apartments.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>The <b>IAgileObject</b> interface is a marker interface that indicates that an object is free threaded and can be called from any apartment.</para>
      <para>Unlike what happens when aggregating the Free Threaded Marshaler (FTM), implementing the <b>IAgileObject</b> interface doesn't affect what happens when marshaling a call. Instead, the <b>IAgileObject</b> interface is recognized by the Global Interface Table (GIT). When an object that implements the <b>IAgileObject</b> interface is placed in the GIT and localized to another apartment, the object is called directly in the new apartment, rather than marshaling.</para>
