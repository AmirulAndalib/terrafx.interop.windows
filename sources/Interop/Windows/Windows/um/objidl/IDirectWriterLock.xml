    <summary>The<b>IDirectWriterLock</b> interface enables a single writer to obtain exclusive write access to a root storage object opened in direct mode while allowing concurrent access by multiple readers. This single-writer, multiple-reader mode does not require the overhead of making a snapshot copy of the storage for the readers.</summary>
