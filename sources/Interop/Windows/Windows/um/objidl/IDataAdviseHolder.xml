      <para>Creates a connection between an advise sink and a data object for receiving notifications.</para>
    </summary>
    <param name="pDataObject">
      <para>A pointer to the <see cref="IDataObject" /> interface on the data object for which notifications are requested. If data in this object changes, a notification is sent to the advise sinks that have requested notification.</para>

    <param name="pFetc">
      <para>A pointer to a <see cref="FORMATETC" /> structure that contains the specified format, medium, and target device that is of interest to the advise sink requesting notification. For example, one sink may want to know only when the bitmap representation of the data in the data object changes. Another sink may be interested in only the metafile format of the same object. Each advise sink is notified when the data of interest changes. This data is passed back to the advise sink when notification occurs.</para>

      <para>A group of flags that  control the advisory connection. Possible values are from the <see cref="ADVF" /> enumeration. However, only some of the possible <b>ADVF</b> values are relevant for this method. The following table briefly describes the relevant values; a more detailed description can be found in the description of the <b>ADVF</b> enumeration.</para>

      <para>An object issues a call to <see cref="IDataObject.DAdvise" /> to request notification on changes to the format, medium, or target device of interest. This data is specified in the <i>pFormatetc</i> parameter. The <b>DAdvise</b> method is usually implemented to call <b>IDataAdviseHolder.Advise</b> to delegate the task of setting up and tracking a connection to the advise holder. When the format, medium, or target device in question changes, the data object calls <see cref="IDataAdviseHolder.SendOnDataChange" /> to send the necessary notifications.</para>
