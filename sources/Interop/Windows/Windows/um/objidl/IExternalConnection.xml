    <summary>Increments the count of an object's strong external connections.</summary>
    <param name="extconn">The type of external connection to the object. The only type of external connection currently supported by this interface is strong, which means that the object must remain alive as long as this external connection exists. Strong external connections are represented by the value EXTCONN_STRONG, which is defined in the enumeration <see cref="EXTCONN" />.</param>
    <param name="reserved">Information about the connection. This parameter is reserved for use by OLE. Its value can be zero, but not necessarily. Therefore, implementations of <b>AddConnection</b> should not contain blocks of code whose execution depends on whether a zero value is returned.</param>
    <returns>The method returns the count of connections. This value is intended to be used only for debugging purposes.</returns>
