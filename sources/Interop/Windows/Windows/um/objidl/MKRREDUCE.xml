  <member name="MKRREDUCE.MKRREDUCE_TOUSER">
    <summary>Reduces the moniker to a form that the user identifies as a persistent object. If no such point exists, then this option should be treated as MKRREDUCE_ALL.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="MKRREDUCE.MKRREDUCE_THROUGHUSER">
    <summary>Reduces the moniker to where any further reduction would reduce it to a form that the user does not identify as a persistent object. Often, this is the same stage as MKRREDUCE_TOUSER.</summary>

  <member name="MKRREDUCE.MKRREDUCE_ALL">
