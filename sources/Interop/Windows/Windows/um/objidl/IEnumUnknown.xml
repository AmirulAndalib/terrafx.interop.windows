  <member name="IEnumUnknown.Clone">
    <summary>
      <para>Creates a new enumerator that contains the same enumeration state as the current one.</para>
      <para>This method makes it possible to record a point in the enumeration sequence in order to return to that point at a later time. The caller must release this new enumerator separately from the first enumerator.</para>

    <param name="ppenum">
      <para>A pointer to the cloned enumerator object.</para>

    <returns>
      <para>This method can return the standard return values E_INVALIDARG, E_OUTOFMEMORY, E_UNEXPECTED, and S_OK.</para>

    <summary>
      <para>Retrieves the specified number of items in the enumeration sequence.</para>
    </summary>
    <param name="celt">
      <para>The number of items to be retrieved. If there are fewer than the requested number of items left in the sequence, this method retrieves the remaining elements.</para>
    </param>
    <param name="rgelt">
      <para>An array of enumerated items.</para>
      <para>The enumerator is responsible for calling <see cref="AddRef" />, and the caller is responsible for calling <see cref="Release" /> through each pointer enumerated. If <i>celt</i> is greater than 1, the caller must also pass a non-NULL pointer passed to <i>pceltFetched</i> to know how many pointers to release.</para>
    </param>
    <param name="pceltFetched">
      <para>The number of items that were retrieved. This parameter is always less than or equal to the number of items requested.</para>
    </param>
    <returns>
      <para>If the method retrieves the number of items requested, the return value is S_OK. Otherwise, it is S_FALSE.</para>

  <member name="IEnumUnknown.Reset">
    <summary>
      <para>Resets the enumeration sequence to the beginning.</para>
    </summary>
    <returns>
      <para>The return value is S_OK.</para>
    </returns>
    <remarks>
      <para>There is no guarantee that the same set of objects will be enumerated after the reset operation has completed. A static collection is reset to the beginning, but it can be too expensive for some collections, such as files in a directory, to guarantee this condition.</para>
