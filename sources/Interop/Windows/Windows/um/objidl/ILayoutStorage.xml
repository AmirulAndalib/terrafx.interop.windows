    <summary>
      <para>The <b>EndMonitor</b> method ends monitoring of a compound file. Must be preceded by a call to
<see cref="ILayoutStorage.BeginMonitor" />.</para>
    </summary>
    <returns>
      <para>This function supports the standard return values E_OUTOFMEMORY, E_UNEXPECTED, E_INVALIDARG, and E_FAIL, as well as all return values for <see cref="CloseHandle" />.</para>
    </returns>
    <remarks>
      <para>A call to
<b>EndMonitor</b> is generally followed by a call to
<see cref="ILayoutStorage.RelayoutDocfile" />, which uses the access pattern detected by the monitoring to restructure the compound file.</para>

      <para>| Return code | Description |
|----------------|---------------|
|STG_E_INVALIDPOINTER | The storage layout pointer is invalid.|
|STG_E_INVALIDFLAG | The value of <i>glfInterleavedFlag</i> is invalid.|
|STG_E_PATHNOTFOUND | The new document file name specified is invalid.|
|STG_E_INSUFFICIENTMEMORY | There is not enough memory to complete the operation.|
|STG_E_INVALIDPARAMETER | One of the parameters is invalid.|
| STG_E_INUSE | The <b>BeginMonitor</b> method was called while <b>ILayoutStorage</b> was already monitoring.|</para>
    </returns>
    <remarks>
      <para>To provide explicit layout instructions, the application calls <b>ILayoutStorage.LayoutScript</b>, passing an array of
<see cref="StorageLayout" /> structures. Each structure defines a single storage or stream data block and specifies where the block is to be written in the
<see cref="ILockBytes" /> byte array.</para>
      <para>An application can combine scripted layout with monitoring, as the structure of a particular compound file may dictate.</para>
      <para>When the optimal data-layout pattern of an entire compound file has been determined, the application calls
<see cref="ILayoutStorage.ReLayoutDocfile" /> to restructure the compound file to match the order in which its data sectors were accessed.</para>

      <para>To optimize a compound file, an application  calls <see cref="CopyTo" />  to layout a docfile, thus improving performance in most scenarios.</para>
