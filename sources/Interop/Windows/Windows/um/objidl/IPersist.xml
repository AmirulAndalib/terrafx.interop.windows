  <member name="IPersist.GetClassID">
    <summary>Retrieves the class identifier (CLSID) of the object.</summary>
    <param name="pClassID">A pointer to the location that receives the CLSID on return. The CLSID is a globally unique identifier (GUID) that uniquely represents an object class that defines the code that can manipulate the object's data.</param>
    <returns>If the method succeeds, the return value is S_OK. Otherwise, it is E_FAIL.</returns>

    <summary>
      <para>Provides the CLSID of an object that can be stored persistently in the system. Allows the object to specify which object handler to use in the client process, as it is used in the default implementation of marshaling.</para>
      <para>
        <b>IPersist</b> is the base interface for three other interfaces: <see cref="IPersistStorage" />, <see cref="IPersistStream" />, and <see cref="IPersistFile" />. Each of these interfaces, therefore, includes the <see cref="GetClassID" /> method, and the appropriate one of these three interfaces is implemented on objects that can be serialized to a storage, a stream, or a file. The methods of these interfaces allow the state of these objects to be saved for later instantiations, and load the object using the saved state. Typically, the persistence interfaces are implemented by an embedded or linked object, and are called by the container application or the default object handler.</para>
