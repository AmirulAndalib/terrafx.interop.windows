  <member name="BIND_OPTS2">
    <summary>Contains parameters used during a moniker-binding operation.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="BIND_OPTS2.cbStruct">
    <summary>The size of this structure, in bytes.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="BIND_OPTS2.grfFlags">
    <summary>Flags that control aspects of moniker binding operations. This value is any combination of the bit flags in the <see cref="BIND_FLAGS" /> enumeration. The <see cref="CreateBindCtx" /> function initializes this member to zero.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="BIND_OPTS2.grfMode">
    <summary>Flags that should be used when opening the file that contains the object identified by the moniker. Possible values are the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/Stg/stgm-constants">STGM constants</a>. The binding operation uses these flags in the call to <see cref="IPersistFile.Load" /> when loading the file. If the object is already running, these flags are ignored by the binding operation. The <see cref="CreateBindCtx" /> function initializes this field to STGM_READWRITE.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="BIND_OPTS2.dwTickCountDeadline">
    <summary>
      <para>The clock time by which the caller would like the binding operation to be completed, in milliseconds. This member lets the caller limit the execution time of an operation when speed is of primary importance. A value of zero indicates that there is no deadline. Callers most often use this capability when calling the <see cref="IMoniker.GetTimeOfLastChange" /> method, though it can be usefully applied to other operations as well. The <see cref="CreateBindCtx" /> function initializes this field to zero.</para>
      <para>Typical deadlines allow for a few hundred milliseconds of execution. This deadline is a recommendation, not a requirement; however, operations that exceed their deadline by a large amount may cause delays for the end user. Each moniker implementation should try to complete its operation by the deadline, or fail with the error MK_E_EXCEEDEDDEADLINE.</para>
      <para>If a binding operation exceeds its deadline because one or more objects that it needs are not running, the moniker implementation should register the objects responsible in the bind context using the <see cref="IBindCtx.RegisterObjectParam" />. The objects should be registered under the parameter names "ExceededDeadline", "ExceededDeadline1", "ExceededDeadline2", and so on. If the caller later finds the object in the running object table, the caller can retry the binding operation.</para>
      <para>The <see cref="GetTickCount" /> function indicates the number of milliseconds since system startup, and wraps back to zero after 2^31 milliseconds. Consequently, callers should be careful not to inadvertently pass a zero value (which indicates no deadline), and moniker implementations should be aware of clock wrapping problems.</para>
    </summary>
  </member>
  <member name="BIND_OPTS2.dwTrackFlags">
    <summary>
      <para>A moniker can use this value during link tracking. If the original persisted data that the moniker is referencing has been moved, the moniker can attempt to reestablish the link by searching for the original data though some adequate mechanism. This member provides additional information on how the link should be resolved. See the documentation of the <i>fFlags</i> parameter in <see cref="IShellLink.Resolve" />.</para>
      <para>COM's file moniker implementation uses the shell link mechanism to reestablish links and passes these flags to <see cref="IShellLink.Resolve" />.</para>
    </summary>
  </member>
  <member name="BIND_OPTS2.dwClassContext">
    <summary>The class context, taken from the <see cref="CLSCTX" /> enumeration, that is to be used for instantiating the object. Monikers typically pass this value to the <i>dwClsContext</i> parameter of <see cref="CoCreateInstance" />.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="BIND_OPTS2.locale">
    <summary>The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/Intl/language-identifier-constants-and-strings">LCID value</a> indicating the client's preference for the locale to be used by the object to which they are binding. A moniker passes this value to <see cref="IClassActivator.GetClassObject" />.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="BIND_OPTS2.pServerInfo">
    <summary>A pointer to a <see cref="COSERVERINFO" /> structure. This member allows clients calling <see cref="IMoniker.BindToObject" /> to specify server information. Clients may pass a <b>BIND_OPTS2</b> structure to the <see cref="IBindCtx.SetBindOptions" /> method. If a server name is specified in the <b>COSERVERINFO</b> structure, the moniker bind will be forwarded to the specified computer. <b>SetBindOptions</b> only copies the struct members of <b>BIND_OPTS2</b>, not the <b>COSERVERINFO</b> structure and the pointers it contains. Callers may not free any of these pointers until the bind context is released. COM's new class moniker does not currently honor the <b>pServerInfo</b> flag.</summary>
