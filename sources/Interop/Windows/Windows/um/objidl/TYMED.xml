  <member name="TYMED.TYMED_HGLOBAL">
    <summary>The storage medium is a global memory handle (<b>HGLOBAL</b>). Allocate the global handle with the GMEM_MOVEABLE flag. If the <b>punkForRelease</b> member of <see cref="STGMEDIUM" /> is <b>NULL</b>, the destination process should use <see cref="GlobalFree" /> to release the memory.</summary>

  <member name="TYMED.TYMED_FILE">
    <summary>The storage medium is a disk file identified by a path. If the <see cref="STGMEDIUM" /><b>punkForRelease</b> member is <b>NULL</b>, the destination process should use <see cref="OpenFile" /> to delete the file.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="TYMED.TYMED_ISTREAM">
    <summary>The storage medium is a stream object identified by an <see cref="IStream" /> pointer. Use <see cref="ISequentialStream.Read" /> to read the data. If the <see cref="STGMEDIUM" /><b>punkForRelease</b> member is not <b>NULL</b>, the destination process should use <see cref="Release" /> to release the stream component.</summary>

  <member name="TYMED.TYMED_ISTORAGE">
    <summary>The storage medium is a storage component identified by an <see cref="IStorage" /> pointer. The data is in the streams and storages contained by this <b>IStorage</b> instance.

  <member name="TYMED.TYMED_GDI">
    <summary>The storage medium is a GDI component (<b>HBITMAP</b>). If the <see cref="STGMEDIUM" /><b>punkForRelease</b> member is <b>NULL</b>, the destination process should use <see cref="DeleteObject" /> to delete the bitmap.</summary>
  </member>

  <member name="TYMED.TYMED_ENHMF">
    <summary>The storage medium is an enhanced metafile (<b>HENHMETAFILE</b>). If the <see cref="STGMEDIUM" /><b>punkForRelease</b> member is <b>NULL</b>, the destination process should use <see cref="DeleteEnhMetaFile" /> to delete the bitmap.</summary>
