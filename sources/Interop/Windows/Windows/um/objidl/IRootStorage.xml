    <summary>The<b>SwitchToFile</b> method copies the current file associated with the storage object to a new file. The new file is then used for the storage object and any uncommitted changes.</summary>
    <param name="pszFile">A pointer to a null terminated string that specifies the file name for the new file. It cannot be the name of an existing file. If <b>NULL</b>, this method creates a temporary file with a unique name, and you can call<see cref="IStorage.Stat" /> to retrieve the name of the temporary file.</param>
    <returns>
      <para>This method can return one of these values.</para>
      <para>| Return code | Description | |----------------|---------------| |S_OK | The file was successfully copied.| |STG_E_MEDIUMFULL | The file was not copied because of insufficient space on the storage device.| |STG_E_ACCESSDENIED | The file was not copied because the caller does not have permission to access storage device.| |STG_E_INVALIDPOINTER | The file was not copied because the <i>pszFile</i> pointer is not valid.| |STG_E_FILEALREADYEXISTS | The file was not copied because the new filename (<i>pszFile</i>) points to an existing file.|</para>

    <summary>The<b>IRootStorage</b> interface contains a single method that switches a storage object to a different underlying file and saves the storage object to that file. The save operation occurs even with low-memory conditions and uncommitted changes to the storage object. A subsequent call to<see cref="IStorage.Commit" /> is guaranteed to not consume additional memory.</summary>
