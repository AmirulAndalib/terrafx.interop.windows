  <member name="IStream">
    <summary>
      <para>The<b>IStream</b> interface lets you read and write data to stream objects. Stream objects contain the data in a structured storage object, where storages provide the structure. Simple data can be written directly to a stream but, most frequently, streams are elements nested within a storage object. They are similar to standard files.</para>
      <para>The<b>IStream</b> interface defines methods similar to the MS-DOS FAT file functions. For example, each stream object has its own access rights and a seek pointer. The main difference between a DOS file and a stream object is that in the latter case, streams are opened using an<b>IStream</b> interface pointer rather than a file handle.</para>
      <para>The methods in this interface present your object's data as a contiguous sequence of bytes that you can read or write. There are also methods for committing and reverting changes on streams that are open in transacted mode and methods for restricting access to a range of bytes in the stream.</para>
      <para>Streams can remain open for long periods of time without consuming file-system resources. The <see cref="IUnknown.Release" /> method is similar to a close function on a file. Once released, the stream object is no longer valid and cannot be used.</para>
