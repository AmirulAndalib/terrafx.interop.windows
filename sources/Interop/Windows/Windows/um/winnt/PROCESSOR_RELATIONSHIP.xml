    <summary>
      <para>Represents information about affinity within a processor group. This structure is used with the <see cref="GetLogicalProcessorInformationEx" /> function.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>The <b>PROCESSOR_RELATIONSHIP</b> structure describes the logical processors associated with either a processor core or a processor package.</para>
      <para>If the <b>PROCESSOR_RELATIONSHIP</b> structure represents a processor core, the <b>GroupCount</b> member is always 1.</para>
      <para>If the <b>PROCESSOR_RELATIONSHIP</b> structure represents a processor package, the  <b>GroupCount</b> member is 1 only if all processors are in the same processor group. If the package contains more than one NUMA node, the system might assign different NUMA nodes to different processor groups. In this case, the <b>GroupCount</b> member is the number of groups to which NUMA nodes in the package are assigned.</para>

    <summary>
      <para>If the <b>Relationship</b> member of the <see cref="SYSTEM_LOGICAL_PROCESSOR_INFORMATION_EX" /> structure is <b>RelationProcessorCore</b>, <b>EfficiencyClass</b> specifies the intrinsic tradeoff between performance and power for the applicable core. A core  with a higher value for the efficiency class has intrinsically greater performance and less efficiency than a core with a lower value for the efficiency class. <b>EfficiencyClass</b> is only nonzero on systems with a heterogeneous set of cores.</para>
