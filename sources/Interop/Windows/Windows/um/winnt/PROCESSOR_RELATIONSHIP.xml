      <para>If the <b>Relationship</b> member of the <see cref="SYSTEM_LOGICAL_PROCESSOR_INFORMATION_EX" /> structure is <b>RelationProcessorCore</b>, this member is LTP_PC_SMT if the core has more than one logical processor, or 0 if the core has one logical processor.</para>

    <summary>
      <para>If the <b>Relationship</b> member of the <see cref="SYSTEM_LOGICAL_PROCESSOR_INFORMATION_EX" /> structure is <b>RelationProcessorCore</b>, <b>EfficiencyClass</b> specifies the intrinsic tradeoff between performance and power for the applicable core. A core with a higher value for the efficiency class has intrinsically greater performance and less efficiency than a core with a lower value for the efficiency class. <b>EfficiencyClass</b> is only nonzero on systems with a heterogeneous set of cores.</para>
