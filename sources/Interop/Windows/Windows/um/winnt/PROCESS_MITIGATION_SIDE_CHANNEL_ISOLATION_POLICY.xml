      <para>Isolate this process into a distinct security domain, even from other processes running as the same security context. This prevents branch target injection cross-process.</para>
      <para>Page combining is limited to processes within the same security domain. This flag effectively limits the process to only combining internally to the process itself, except for common pages and unless further restricted by the<b>DisablePageCombine</b> policy.</para>
