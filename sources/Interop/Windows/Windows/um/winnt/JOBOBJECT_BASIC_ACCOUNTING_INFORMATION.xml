    <summary>The total number of processes associated with the job during its lifetime, including those that have terminated. For example, when a process is associated with a job, but the association fails because of a limit violation, this value is incremented.</summary>

    <summary>The total number of processes currently associated with the job. When a process is associated with a job, but the association fails because of a limit violation, this value is temporarily incremented. When the terminated process exits and all references to the process are released, this value is decremented.</summary>
