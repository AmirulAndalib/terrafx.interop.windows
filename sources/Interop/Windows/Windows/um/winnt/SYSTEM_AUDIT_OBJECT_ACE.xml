  <member name="SYSTEM_AUDIT_OBJECT_ACE">
    <summary>
      <para>The <b>SYSTEM_AUDIT_OBJECT_ACE</b> structure defines an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/SecGloss/a-gly">access control entry</a> (ACE) for a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly">system access control list</a> (SACL). The ACE can audit access to an object or subobjects such as  property sets or properties. The ACE contains a set of access rights, a GUID that identifies the type of object or subobject, and a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly">security identifier</a> (SID) that identifies the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/SecGloss/t-gly">trustee</a> for whom the system will audit access. The ACE also contains a GUID and a set of flags that control inheritance of the ACE by child objects.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>If neither the <b>ObjectType</b> nor <b>InheritedObjectType</b> GUID is specified, the <b>SYSTEM_AUDIT_OBJECT_ACE</b> structure has the same semantics as the <see cref="SYSTEM_AUDIT_ACE" /> structure. In that case, use the
<b>SYSTEM_AUDIT_ACE</b> structure because it is smaller and more efficient.</para>
      <para>An ACL that contains an <b>SYSTEM_AUDIT_OBJECT_ACE</b> must specify the ACL_REVISION_DS revision number in its
<see cref="ACE_HEADER" /> structure.</para>
      <para>When a <b>SYSTEM_AUDIT_OBJECT_ACE</b> structure is created, sufficient memory must be allocated to accommodate the GUID structures in <b>ObjectType</b> and <b>InheritedObjectType</b> members, if one or both of them exists, as well as to accommodate the complete SID of the trustee in the <b>SidStart</b> member and the contiguous memory that follows it.</para>
      <para>An <b>SYSTEM_AUDIT_OBJECT_ACE</b> structure can be created in an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/SecGloss/a-gly">access control list</a> (ACL) by a call to the <see cref="AddAuditAccessObjectAce" /> function. When this function is used, the correct amount of memory needed to accommodate the GUID structures in the <b>ObjectType</b> and <b>InheritedObjectType</b> members, if one or both of them exists, as well as to accommodate the trustee's SID is automatically allocated. In addition, the values of the <b>Header.AceType</b> and <b>Header.AceSize</b> members are set automatically.    When an <b>SYSTEM_AUDIT_OBJECT_ACE</b> structure is created outside an ACL, sufficient memory must be allocated to accommodate the GUID structures in the <b>ObjectType</b> and <b>InheritedObjectType</b> members, if one or both of them exists, as well as to accommodate the complete SID of the trustee in the <b>SidStart</b> member and the contiguous memory following it. In addition,  the values of the <b>Header.AceType</b> and <b>Header.AceSize</b> members must be set explicitly by the application.</para>

      <para>An
