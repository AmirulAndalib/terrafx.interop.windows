  <member name="PROCESS_MITIGATION_USER_SHADOW_STACK_POLICY.DUMMYUNIONNAME.DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.EnableUserShadowStack">
    <summary>
      <para>If TRUE, user-mode Hardware-enforced Stack Protection is enabled for the process in compatibility mode.
This means that the CPU verifies function return addresses at runtime by employing a shadow stack mechanism, if supported by the hardware.
In compatibility mode, only shadow stack violations occurring in modules that are considered compatible with shadow stacks (CETCOMPAT) are fatal.
For a module to be considered CETCOMPAT, it needs to be either compiled with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//cpp/build/reference/cetcompat">CETCOMPAT</a> for binaries, or marked using
<see cref="SetProcessDynamicEnforcedCetCompatibleRanges" /> for dynamic code.

  <member name="PROCESS_MITIGATION_USER_SHADOW_STACK_POLICY.DUMMYUNIONNAME.DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.EnableUserShadowStackStrictMode">
    <summary>
      <para>If TRUE, user-mode Hardware-enforced Stack Protection is enabled for the process in strict mode. All shadow stack violations are fatal.
When this field is TRUE, EnableUserShadowStack must be TRUE.
If HSP is enabled in compatibility mode, it can be upgraded to strict mode at runtime by setting this field to TRUE and calling <see cref="SetProcessMitigationPolicy" />.
HSP cannot be downgraded or disabled via <see cref="SetProcessMitigationPolicy" />.
If HSP is disabled, it cannot be enabled via <see cref="SetProcessMitigationPolicy" />.</para>

      <para>If TRUE, when calling APIs that modify the execution context of a thread such as <see cref="SetThreadContext" /> and <see cref="RtlRestoreContext" />, validation is performed on the Instruction Pointer specified in the new execution context.
This field cannot be changed via <see cref="SetProcessMitigationPolicy" />.</para>

  <member name="PROCESS_MITIGATION_USER_SHADOW_STACK_POLICY.DUMMYUNIONNAME.DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.SetContextIpValidationRelaxedMode">

      <para>If TRUE, the process's Instruction Pointer validation is downgraded to relaxed mode, which allows all Instruction Pointers that are in dynamic code or in binaries that do not contain <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//cpp/build/reference/guard-enable-eh-continuation-metadata">exception handling continuation metadata</a>.
When this field is TRUE, SetContextIpValidation must be TRUE.
The process can be upgraded from relaxed mode to normal mode at runtime by setting this field to FALSE and calling <see cref="SetProcessMitigationPolicy" />.</para>
