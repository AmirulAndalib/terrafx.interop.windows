      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/SecGloss/l-gly">Locally unique identifier</a> (LUID) for the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/SecGloss/l-gly">logon session</a>. If the token passed to <see cref="GetTokenInformation" /> resulted from a logon using explicit credentials, such as passing name, domain, and password to the <see cref="LogonUser" /> function, then this member will contain the ID of the <i>logon session</i> that created it. If the token resulted from network authentication, such as a call to <see cref="AcceptSecurityContext" />, or a call to <b>LogonUser</b> with <i>dwLogonType</i> set to LOGON32_LOGON_NETWORK or LOGON32_LOGON_NETWORK_CLEARTEXT, then this member will be zero.</summary>
