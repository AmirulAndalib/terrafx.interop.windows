      <para>Contains basic limit information for a job object.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>Processes can still empty their working sets using the
<see cref="SetProcessWorkingSetSize" /> function with (<b>SIZE_T</b>)-1, even when <b>JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_WORKINGSET</b> is used. However, you cannot use <b>SetProcessWorkingSetSize</b> change the minimum or maximum working set size of a process in a job object.</para>
      <para>The system increments the active process count when you attempt to associate a process with a job. If the limit is exceeded, the system decrements the active process count only when the process terminates and all handles to the process are closed. Therefore, if you have an open handle to a process that has been terminated in such a manner, you cannot associate any new processes until the handle is closed and the active process count is below the limit.</para>

      <para>The system adds the current time of the processes associated with the job to this limit. For example, if you set this limit to 1 minute, and the job has a process that has accumulated 5 minutes of user-mode time, the limit actually enforced is 6 minutes.</para>
