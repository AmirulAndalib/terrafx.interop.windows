      <para>To wake the computer using the RTC, the operating system must also support waking from the sleep state the computer is in when the RTC generates the wake event. Therefore, the effective lowest sleep state from which an RTC wake event can wake the computer is the lowest sleep state supported by the operating system that is equal to or higher than the value of <b>RtcWake</b>. To determine the sleep states that the operating system supports, check the <b>SystemS1</b>, <b>SystemS2</b>, <b>SystemS3</b>, and <b>SystemS4</b> members.</para>
