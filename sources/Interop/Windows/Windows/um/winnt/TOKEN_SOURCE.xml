  <member name="TOKEN_SOURCE">
    <summary>The <b>TOKEN_SOURCE</b> structure identifies the source of an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/SecGloss/a-gly">access token</a>.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="TOKEN_SOURCE.SourceName">
    <summary>Specifies an 8-byte character string used to identify the source of an access token. This is used to distinguish between such sources as Session Manager, LAN Manager, and RPC Server. A string, rather than a constant, is used to identify the source so users and developers can make extensions to the system, such as by adding other networks, that act as the source of access tokens.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="TOKEN_SOURCE.SourceIdentifier">
    <summary>Specifies a locally unique identifier (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/SecGloss/l-gly">LUID</a>) provided by the source component named by the <b>SourceName</b> member. This value aids the source component in relating context blocks, such as session-control structures, to the token. This value is typically, but not necessarily, an LUID.</summary>
