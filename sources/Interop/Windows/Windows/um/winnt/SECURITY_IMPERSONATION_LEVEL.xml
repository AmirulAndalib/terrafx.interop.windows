  <member name="SECURITY_IMPERSONATION_LEVEL">
    <summary>The <b>SECURITY_IMPERSONATION_LEVEL</b> enumeration contains values that specify security impersonation levels. Security impersonation levels govern the degree to which a server process can act on behalf of a client <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/SecGloss/p-gly">process</a>.</summary>

  <member name="SECURITY_IMPERSONATION_LEVEL.SecurityAnonymous">
    <summary>The server process cannot obtain identification information about the client, and it cannot impersonate the client. It is defined with no value given, and thus, by ANSI C rules, defaults to a value of zero.</summary>

  <member name="SECURITY_IMPERSONATION_LEVEL.SecurityIdentification">
    <summary>The server process can obtain information about the client, such as security identifiers and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/SecGloss/p-gly">privileges</a>, but it cannot impersonate the client. This is useful for servers that export their own objects, for example, database products that export tables and views. Using the retrieved client-security information, the server can make access-validation decisions without being able to use other services that are using the client's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly">security context</a>.</summary>
