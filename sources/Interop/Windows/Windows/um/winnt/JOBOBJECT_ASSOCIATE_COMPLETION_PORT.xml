    <summary>
      <para>Contains information used to associate a completion port with a job. You can associate one completion port with a job.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>The system sends messages to the I/O completion port associated with a job when certain events occur. If the job is nested, the message is sent to every I/O completion port associated with any job in the parent job chain of the job that triggered the message. All messages are sent directly from the job as if the job had called the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/FileIO/postqueuedcompletionstatus">PostQueuedCompletionStatus</a> function.</para>
      <para>Note that, except for limits set with the <b>JobObjectNotificationLimitInformation</b> information class, messages are intended only as notifications and their delivery to the completion port is not guaranteed. The failure of a message to arrive at the completion port does not necessarily mean that the event did not occur. Notifications for limits set with <b>JobObjectNotificationLimitInformation</b> are guaranteed to arrive at the completion port.</para>
      <para>A thread must monitor the completion port using the
<see cref="GetQueuedCompletionStatus" /> function to pick up the messages. The thread receives information in the <b>GetQueuedCompletionStatus</b> parameters shown in the following table.</para>

      <para>You must be cautious when using the JOB_OBJECT_MSG_NEW_PROCESS and JOB_OBJECT_MSG_EXIT_PROCESS messages, as race conditions may occur. For instance, if processes are actively starting and exiting within a job, and you are in the process of assigning a completion port to the job, you may miss messages for processes whose states change during the association of the completion port. For this reason, it is best to associate a completion port with a job when the job is inactive.</para>
