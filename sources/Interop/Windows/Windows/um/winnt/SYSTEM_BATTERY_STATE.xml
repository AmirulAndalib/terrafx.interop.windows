  <member name="SYSTEM_BATTERY_STATE.Rate">
    <summary>The current rate of discharge of the battery, in mW. A nonzero, positive rate indicates charging; a negative rate indicates discharging. Some batteries report only discharging rates. This value should be treated as a <b>LONG</b> as it can contain negative values (with the high bit set).</summary>

    <summary>The manufacturer's suggestion of a capacity, in mWh, at which a low battery alert should occur. Definitions of low vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. In general, a warning state will occur before a low state, but you should not assume that it always will. To reduce risk of data loss, this value is usually used as the default setting for the critical battery alarm.</summary>
