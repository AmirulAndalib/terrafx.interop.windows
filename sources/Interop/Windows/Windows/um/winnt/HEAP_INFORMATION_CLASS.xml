      <para>
        <b>Windows XP and Windows Server 2003:  </b> A look-aside list is a fast memory allocation mechanism that contains only fixed-sized blocks. Look-aside lists are enabled by default for heaps that support them. Starting with Windows Vista, look-aside lists are not used and the LFH is enabled by default.</para>
      <para>Look-aside lists are faster than general pool allocations that vary in size, because the system does not search for free memory that fits the allocation. In addition, access to look-aside lists is generally synchronized using fast atomic processor exchange instructions instead of mutexes or spinlocks. Look-aside lists can be created by the system or drivers. They can be allocated from paged or nonpaged pool.</para>

      <para>The heap features that are enabled. The available features vary based on operating system. Depending on the <i>HeapInformation</i> parameter in the <see cref="HeapQueryInformation" /> or <see cref="HeapSetInformation" /> functions, specifying this enumeration value can indicate one of the following features:</para>

      <para>The terminate-on-corruption feature. If the heap manager detects an error in any heap used by the
process, it calls the Windows Error Reporting service and terminates the process.</para>
