  <member name="PERFORMANCE_DATA">
    <summary>Contains the thread profiling and hardware counter data that you requested.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="PERFORMANCE_DATA.Size">
    <summary>The size of this structure.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="PERFORMANCE_DATA.Version">
    <summary>The version of this structure. Must be set to PERFORMANCE_DATA_VERSION.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="PERFORMANCE_DATA.HwCountersCount">
    <summary>The number of array elements in the <b>HwCounters</b> array that contain hardware counter data. A value of 3 means that the array contains data for three hardware counters, not that elements 0 through 2 contain counter data.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="PERFORMANCE_DATA.ContextSwitchCount">
    <summary>The number of context switches that occurred from the time profiling was enabled.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="PERFORMANCE_DATA.WaitReasonBitMap">
    <summary>A bitmask that identifies the reasons for the context switches that occurred since the last time the data was read. For possible values, see the <b>KWAIT_REASON</b> enumeration (the enumeration is included in the Wdm.h file in the WDK).</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="PERFORMANCE_DATA.CycleTime">
    <summary>The cycle time of the thread (excludes the time spent interrupted) from the time profiling was enabled.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="PERFORMANCE_DATA.RetryCount">
    <summary>The number of times that the read operation read the data to ensure a consistent snapshot of the data.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="PERFORMANCE_DATA.Reserved">
    <summary>Reserved. Set to zero.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="PERFORMANCE_DATA.HwCounters">
    <summary>An array of <see cref="HARDWARE_COUNTER_DATA" /> structures that contain the counter values. The elements of the array that contain counter data relate directly to the bits set in the <i>HardwareCounters</i> bitmask that you specified when you called the <see cref="EnableThreadProfiling" /> function. For example, if you set bit 3 in the <i>HardwareCounters</i> bitmask, HwCounters[3] will contain the counter data for that counter.</summary>
