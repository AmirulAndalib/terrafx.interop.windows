  <member name="IThumbnailProvider.GetThumbnail">
    <summary>Gets a thumbnail image and alpha type.</summary>
    <param name="cx">The maximum thumbnail size, in pixels. The Shell draws the returned bitmap at this size or smaller. The returned bitmap should fit into a square of width and height <i>cx</i>, though it does not need to be a square image. The Shell scales the bitmap to render at lower sizes. For example, if the image has a 6:4 aspect ratio, then the returned bitmap should also have a 6:4 aspect ratio.</param>
    <param name="phbmp">When this method returns, contains a pointer to the thumbnail image handle. The image must be a DIB section and 32 bits per pixel. The Shell scales down the bitmap if its width or height is larger than the size specified by <i>cx</i>. The Shell always respects the aspect ratio and never scales a bitmap larger than its original size.</param>
    <param name="pdwAlpha">
      <para>When this method returns, contains a pointer to one of the following values from the WTS_ALPHATYPE enumeration:</para>
      <h4>WTSAT_UNKNOWN (0x0)</h4>
      <para>0x0. The bitmap is an unknown format. The Shell tries nonetheless to detect whether the image has an alpha channel.</para>
      <h4>WTSAT_RGB (0x1)</h4>
      <para>0x1. The bitmap is an RGB image without alpha. The alpha channel is invalid and the Shell ignores it.</para>
      <h4>WTSAT_ARGB (0x2)</h4>
      <para>0x2. The bitmap is an ARGB image with a valid alpha channel.</para>
    </param>
    <returns>If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.</returns>
