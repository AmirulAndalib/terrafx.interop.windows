  <member name="IViewObject2.GetExtent">
    <summary>Retrieves the size that the specified view object will be drawn on the specified target device.</summary>
    <param name="dwDrawAspect">Requested view of the object whose size is of interest. Possible values are taken from the <see cref="DVASPECT" /> and <see cref="DVASPECT2" /> enumerations. Note that newer objects and containers that support optimized drawing interfaces support the <b>DVASPECT2</b> enumeration values. Older objects and containers that do not support optimized drawing interfaces may not support <b>DVASPECT2</b>.</param>
    <param name="lindex">The portion of the object that is of interest. Currently, the only possible value is -1.</param>
    <param name="ptd">A pointer to the <see cref="DVTARGETDEVICE" /> structure defining the target device for which the object's size should be returned.</param>
    <param name="lpsizel">A pointer to where the object's size is returned.</param>

  <member name="IViewObject2">
    <summary>
      <para>An extension to the <see cref="IViewObject" /> interface which returns the size of the drawing for a given view of an object. You can prevent the object from being run if it isn't already running by calling this method instead of <see cref="IOleObject.GetExtent" />.</para>
      <para>Like the <see cref="IViewObject" /> interface, <b>IViewObject2</b> cannot be marshaled to another process. This is because device contexts are only effective in the context of one process.</para>
      <para>The OLE-provided default implementation provides the size of the object in the cache.</para>
