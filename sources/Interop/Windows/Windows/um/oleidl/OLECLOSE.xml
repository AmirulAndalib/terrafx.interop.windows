    <summary>If the object is dirty, the <see cref="IOleObject.Close" /> implementation should display a dialog box to let the end user determine whether to save the object. However, if the object is in the running state but its user interface is invisible, the end user should not be prompted, and the close should be handled as if OLECLOSE_SAVEIFDIRTY had been specified.</summary>
