  <member name="IStreamUnbufferedInfo.GetSectorSize">
    <summary>Retrieves the number of bytes per sector on the disk currently being used. When using unbuffered input/output (I/O), it is important to know the size of the sectors on the disk being read in order to ensure proper byte alignment.</summary>
    <param name="pcbSectorSize">When this method returns successfully, contains a pointer to a <b>ULONG</b> value that represents the number of bytes per sector for the disk.</param>
    <returns>If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.</returns>
