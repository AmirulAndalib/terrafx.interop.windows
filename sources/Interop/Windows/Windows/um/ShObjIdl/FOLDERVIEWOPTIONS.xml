  <member name="FOLDERVIEWOPTIONS.FVO_VISTALAYOUT">
    <summary>0x00000001. Use the Windows Vista list view. This can be used to maintain continuity between systems so that users are presented with an expected view. At this time, setting this flag has the effective, though not literal, result of the application of the FVO_CUSTOMPOSITION and FVO_CUSTOMORDERING flags. However, this could change. Applications should be specific about the behaviors that they require. For instance, if an application requires custom positioning of its items, it should not rely on FVO_VISTALAYOUT to provide it, but instead explicitly apply the FVO_CUSTOMPOSITION flag.</summary>
