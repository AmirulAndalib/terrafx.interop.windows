  <member name="IStreamAsync.CancelIo">
    <summary>Marks all pending input/output (I/O) operations as canceled.</summary>
    <returns>If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.</returns>
  </member>
  <member name="IStreamAsync.OverlappedResult">
    <summary>Retrieves the results of an overlapped operation.</summary>
    <param name="lpOverlapped">A pointer to the <see cref="OVERLAPPED" /> structure that was specified when the overlapped operation was started.</param>
    <param name="lpNumberOfBytesTransferred">When this method returns, contains the number of bytes that were actually transferred by a read or write operation.</param>
    <param name="bWait">If <b>TRUE</b> the method does not return until the operation has been completed. If <b>FALSE</b> and an operation is pending, the method returns the HRESULT equivalent to ERROR_IO_INCOMPLETE.</param>
    <returns>If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.</returns>

  <member name="IStreamAsync.ReadAsync">
    <summary>Reads information from a stream asynchronously. For example, the Shell implements this interface on file items when transferring them asynchronously.</summary>
    <param name="pv">When this method returns successfully, returns a buffer that is <i>cb</i> bytes long and contains <i>pcbRead</i> bytes of information from the read operation.</param>
    <param name="cb">The number of bytes to read from the stream.</param>
    <param name="pcbRead">Pointer to a <b>DWORD</b> value that, when this method returns successfully, states the actual number of bytes read to the buffer pointed to by <i>pv</i>. This value can be <b>NULL</b>.</param>
    <param name="lpOverlapped">A pointer to an <see cref="OVERLAPPED" /> structure that contains information used in the asynchronous read operation.</param>
    <returns>If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.</returns>

  <member name="IStreamAsync.WriteAsync">
    <summary>Writes information to a stream asynchronously. For example, the Shell implements this method on file items when transferring them asynchronously.</summary>
    <param name="lpBuffer">A pointer to a buffer of size <i>cb</i> bytes that contains the information to be written to the stream.</param>
    <param name="cb">The size of the buffer pointed to by <i>lpBuffer</i>, in bytes.</param>
    <param name="pcbWritten">Pointer to a <b>DWORD</b> value that, when the method returns successfully, states the actual number of bytes written to the stream. This value can be <b>NULL</b> if this information is not needed.</param>
    <param name="lpOverlapped">A pointer to an <see cref="OVERLAPPED" /> structure that contains information used in the asynchronous write operation.</param>
    <returns>If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.</returns>
