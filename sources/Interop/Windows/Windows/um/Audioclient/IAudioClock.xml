    <remarks>
      <para>The device frequency is the frequency generated by the hardware clock in the audio device. This method reports the device frequency in units that are compatible with those of the device position that the <see cref="IAudioClock.GetPosition" /> method reports. For example, if, for a particular stream, the <b>GetPosition</b> method expresses the position <i>p</i> as a byte offset, the <b>GetFrequency</b> method expresses the frequency <i>f</i> in bytes per second. For any stream, the offset in seconds from the start of the stream can always be reliably calculated as <i>p</i>/<i>f</i> regardless of the units in which <i>p</i> and <i>f</i> are expressed.</para>
      <para>In Windows Vista, the device frequency reported by successive calls to <b>GetFrequency</b> never changes during the lifetime of a stream.</para>
      <para>If the clock generated by an audio device runs at a nominally constant frequency, the frequency might still vary slightly over time due to drift or jitter with respect to a reference clock. The reference clock might be a wall clock or the system clock used by the <b>QueryPerformanceCounter</b> function. The <b>GetFrequency</b> method ignores such variations and simply reports a constant frequency. However, the position reported by the <b>IAudioClient.GetPosition</b> method takes all such variations into account to report an accurate position value each time it is called. For more information about <b>QueryPerformanceCounter</b>, see the Windows SDK documentation.</para>

      <para>Rendering or capture clients that need to expose a clock based on the stream's current playback or record position can use this method to derive that clock.</para>
      <para>This method retrieves two correlated stream-position values:</para>
      <list type="bullet">
        <item>
          <description>Device position. The client obtains the device position through output parameter <i>pu64Position</i>. This is the stream position of the sample that is currently playing through the speakers (for a rendering stream) or being recorded through the microphone (for a capture stream).</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>Performance counter. The client obtains the performance counter through output parameter <i>pu64QPCPosition</i>. This is the counter value that the method obtained by calling the <b>QueryPerformanceCounter</b> function at the time that the audio endpoint device recorded the stream position (<i>*pu64Position</i>). Note that <b>GetPosition</b> converts the counter value to 100-nanosecond time units.</description>
        </item>
      </list>
      <para>The device position is meaningless unless it is combined with the device frequency reported by the <b>IAudioClock.GetFrequency</b> method. The reason is that the units in which the device positions for different streams are expressed might vary according to factors such as whether the stream was opened in shared mode or exclusive mode. However, the frequency <i>f</i> obtained from <b>GetFrequency</b> is always expressed in units that are compatible with those of the device position <i>p</i>. Thus, the stream-relative offset in seconds can always be calculated as <i>p</i>/<i>f</i>.</para>
      <para>The device position is a stream-relative offset. That is, it is specified as an offset from the start of the stream. The device position can be thought of as an offset into an idealized buffer that contains the entire stream and is contiguous from beginning to end.</para>
      <para>Given the device position and the performance counter at the time of the <b>GetPosition</b> call, the client can provide a more timely estimate of the device position at a slightly later time by calling <b>QueryPerformanceCounter</b> to obtain the current performance counter, and extrapolating the device position based on how far the counter has advanced since the original device position was recorded. The client can call the <b>QueryPerformanceFrequency</b> function to determine the frequency of the clock that increments the counter. Before comparing the raw counter value obtained from <b>QueryPerformanceCounter</b> to the value written to <i>*pu64QPCPosition</i> by <b>GetPosition</b>, convert the raw counter value to 100-nanosecond time units as follows:</para>
      <list type="number">
        <item>
          <description>Multiply the raw counter value by 10,000,000.</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>Divide the result by the counter frequency obtained from <b>QueryPerformanceFrequency</b>.</description>
        </item>
      </list>
      <para>For more information about <b>QueryPerformanceCounter</b> and <b>QueryPerformanceFrequency</b>, see the Windows SDK documentation.</para>
      <para>Immediately following creation of a new stream, the device position is 0. Following a call to the <see cref="IAudioClient.Start" /> method, the device position increments at a uniform rate. The <see cref="IAudioClient.Stop" /> method freezes the device position, and a subsequent <b>Start</b> call causes the device position to resume incrementing from its value at the time of the <b>Stop</b> call. A call to <see cref="IAudioClient.Reset" />, which should only occur while the stream is stopped, resets the device position to 0.</para>
      <para>When a new or reset rendering stream initially begins running, its device position might remain 0 for a few milliseconds until the audio data has had time to propagate from the endpoint buffer to the rendering endpoint device. The device position changes from 0 to a nonzero value when the data begins playing through the device.</para>
      <para>Successive device readings are monotonically increasing. Although the device position might not change between two successive readings, the device position never decreases from one reading to the next.</para>
      <para>The <i>pu64Position</i> parameter must be a valid, non-<b>NULL</b> pointer or the method will fail and return error code E_POINTER.</para>
      <para>Position measurements might occasionally be delayed by intermittent, high-priority events. These events might be unrelated to audio. In the case of an exclusive-mode stream, the method can return S_FALSE instead of S_OK if the method succeeds but the duration of the call is long enough to detract from the accuracy of the reported position. When this occurs, the caller has the option of calling the method again to attempt to retrieve a more accurate position (as indicated by return value S_OK). However, the caller should avoid performing this test in an infinite loop in the event that the method consistently returns S_FALSE.</para>
