    <summary>The size of the <b>NETCONNECTINFOSTRUCT</b> structure, in bytes. This is filled in by the caller to indicate the size of the structure passed in.

          <description>If set, the connection is not treated as being routed. In other words, routing is not taken into account when estimating the performance. This means actual performance may be much less than the information returned. <para>If not set, the connection may be going through routers that limit performance.</para></description>

  <member name="NETCONNECTINFOSTRUCT.dwSpeed">
    <summary>The speed of the media to the network resource in units of 100bps. For example, a 1,200 baud point-to-point link returns 12.</summary>

  <member name="NETCONNECTINFOSTRUCT.dwDelay">
    <summary>The delay introduced by the network when sending information, in milliseconds. In other words, the time between when the network starts to send data and the time it is received. This is in addition to any latency that was incorporated into the calculation of <b>dwSpeed</b>, so the value returned will be zero for accessing most resources.</summary>

  <member name="NETCONNECTINFOSTRUCT.dwOptDataSize">
    <summary>A recommendation for the size of data, in bytes, that is most efficiently sent through the network when an application makes a single request to the network resource. For example, for a disk network resource, this value might be 2048 or 512 when writing a block of data.</summary>
