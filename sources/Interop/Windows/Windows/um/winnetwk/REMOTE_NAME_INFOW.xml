      <para>The <b>REMOTE_NAME_INFO</b> structure contains information about the remote form of a universal name. It is used by the

      <blockquote>
        <para>[!NOTE]
The winnetwk.h header defines REMOTE_NAME_INFO as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors.
