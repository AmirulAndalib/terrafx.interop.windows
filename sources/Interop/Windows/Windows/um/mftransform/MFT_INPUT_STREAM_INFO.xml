  <member name="MFT_INPUT_STREAM_INFO">
    <summary>Contains information about an input stream on a Media Foundation transform (MFT). To get these values, call <see cref="IMFTransform.GetInputStreamInfo" />.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="MFT_INPUT_STREAM_INFO.hnsMaxLatency">
    <summary>Maximum amount of time between an input sample and the corresponding output sample, in 100-nanosecond units. For example, an MFT that buffers two samples, each with a duration of 1 second, has a maximum latency of two seconds. If the MFT always turns input samples directly into output samples, with no buffering, the latency is zero.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="MFT_INPUT_STREAM_INFO.dwFlags">
    <summary>Bitwise <b>OR</b> of zero or more flags from the <see cref="_MFT_INPUT_STREAM_INFO_FLAGS" /> enumeration.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="MFT_INPUT_STREAM_INFO.cbSize">
    <summary>The minimum size of each input buffer, in bytes. If the size is variable or the MFT does not require a specific size, the value is zero. For uncompressed audio, the value should be the audio frame size, which you can get from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/medfound/mf-mt-audio-block-alignment-attribute">MF_MT_AUDIO_BLOCK_ALIGNMENT</a> attribute in the media type.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="MFT_INPUT_STREAM_INFO.cbMaxLookahead">
    <summary>Maximum amount of input data, in bytes, that the MFT holds to perform lookahead. <i>Lookahead</i> is the action of looking forward in the data before processing it. This value should be the worst-case value. If the MFT does not keep a lookahead buffer, the value is zero.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="MFT_INPUT_STREAM_INFO.cbAlignment">
    <summary>The memory alignment required for input buffers. If the MFT does not require a specific alignment, the value is zero.</summary>
