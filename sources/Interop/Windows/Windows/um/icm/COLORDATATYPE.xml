    <summary>Color data is stored as 16 bits per channel, with a fixed range of -4 to +4, inclusive. A signed format is used, with 1 bit for the sign, 2 bits for the integer portion, and 13 bits for the fractional portion.</summary>

    <summary>Color data is stored as 10 bits per channel. The two most significant bits are alpha.</summary>

    <summary>
      <para>Color data is stored as 10 bits per channel, 32 bits per pixel. The 10 bits of each color channel are 2.8 fixed point with a -0.75 bias, giving a range of [-0.76 .. 1.25]. This range corresponds to [-0.5 .. 1.5] in a gamma = 1 space. The two most significant bits are preserved for alpha.</para>
      <para>This uses an extended range (XR) sRGB color space. It has the same RGB primaries, white point, and gamma as sRGB.</para>
