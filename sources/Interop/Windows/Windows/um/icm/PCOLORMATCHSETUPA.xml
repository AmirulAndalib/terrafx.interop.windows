    <summary>
      <para>A set of bit flags used to initialize the dialog box. If set to 0 on entry, all controls assume their default states.</para>
      <para>When the dialog box returns, these flags are set to indicate the user's input.</para>
      <para>This member can be set using a combination of the following flags.</para>
      <para>| Flag | Meaning | |-|-| | CMS_DISABLEICM | If set on entry, this flag indicates that the "Enable Color Management" check box is cleared, disabling all other controls. If set on exit, it means that the user does not wish color management performed. | | CMS_ENABLEPROOFING | If set on entry, this flag indicates that the Proofing controls are to be enabled, and the Proofing check box is checked. If set on exit, it means that the user wishes to perform color management for a different target device than the selected printer. | | CMS_SETRENDERINTENT | If set on entry, this flag indicates that the <b>dwRenderIntent</b> member contains the value to use to initialize the Rendering Intent control. Otherwise, the control defaults to Picture rendering. This flag is set on exit if WCS is enabled. | | CMS_SETPROOFINTENT | Ignored unless CMS_ENABLEPROOFING is also set. If set on entry, and CMS_ENABLEPROOFING is also set, this flag indicates that the <b>dwProofingIntent</b> member is to be used to initialize the Target Rendering Intent control. Otherwise, the control defaults to Picture rendering. This flag is set on exit if proofing is enabled. | | CMS_SETMONITORPROFILE | If set on entry, this flag indicates that the color management profile named in the <b>pMonitorProfile</b> member is to be the initial selection in the monitor profile control. If the specified profile is not associated with the monitor, this flag is ignored, and the default profile for the monitor is used. | | CMS_SETPRINTERPROFILE | If set on entry, this flag indicates that the color management profile named in the <b>pPrinterProfile</b> member is to be the initial selection in the printer profile control. If the specified profile is not associated with the printer, this flag is ignored, and the default profile for the printer is used. | | CMS_SETTARGETPROFILE | If set on entry, this flag indicates that the color profile named in the <b>pTargetProfile</b> member is to be the initial selection in the target profile control. If the specified profile is not installed, this flag is ignored, and the default profile for the printer is used. If the printer has no default profile, then the first profile in alphabetical order will be displayed. | | CMS_USEHOOK | This flag specifies that the <b>lpfnHook</b> member contains the address of a hook procedure, and the <b>lParam</b> member contains a value to be passed to the hook procedure when the WM_INITDIALOG message is sent. | | CMS_MONITOROVERFLOW | This flag is set on exit if color management is to be enabled and the buffer size given in <b>ccMonitorProfile</b> is insufficient for the selected profile name. <b>GetLastError</b> returns ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER in such a case. | | CMS_PRINTERROVERFLOW | This flag is set on exit if color management is to be enabled and the buffer size given in <b>ccPrinterProfile</b> is insufficient for the selected profile name. <b>GetLastError</b> returns ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER in such a case. | | CMS_TARGETOVERFLOW | This flag is set on exit if proofing is to be enabled and the buffer size given in <b>ccTargetProfile</b> is insufficient for the selected profile name. <b>GetLastError</b> returns ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER in such a case. | | CMS_USEAPPLYCALLBACK | If set on entry, this flag indicates that the <b>SetupColorMatching</b> function should call the function <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/win32/api/icm/nc-icm-pcmscallbackw">PCMSCALLBACKW</a>. The address of the callback function is contained in <i>lpfnApplyCallback</i>. | | CMS_USEDESCRIPTION | If set on entry, this flag instructs the <b>SetupColorMatching</b> function to retrieve the profile description contained in the profile description tags (See ICC Profile Format Specification v3.4). It will insert them into the <b>Monitor Profile</b>, <b>Printer Profile</b>, <b>Emulated Device Profile</b> edit boxes in the <b>Color Management</b> common dialog box. |</para>
