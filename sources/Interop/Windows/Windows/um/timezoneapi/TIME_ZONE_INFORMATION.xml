    <summary>
      <para>The current bias for local time translation on this computer, in minutes. The bias is the difference, in minutes, between Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and local time. All translations between UTC and local time are based on the following formula:</para>

      <para>A description for standard time. For example, "EST" could indicate Eastern Standard Time. The string will be  returned unchanged by the

      <para>A
