    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>Dynamic daylight saving time provides support for time zones whose boundaries for daylight saving time change
from year to year. This feature enables easier updating of systems, especially for locales where the yearly DST
boundaries are known in advance. After the time zone has been updated, the current time zone setting is applied to
all time operations, even when the time in question occurred before the time zone changed. Therefore, it is best
to store UTC times and convert them to the current local time zone.</para>
      <para>You can set the transition dates for the current year using the
<see cref="SetDynamicTimeZoneInformation" /> function.
To set future transition dates, you must add entries to the registry data. The settings for dynamic daylight time
are stored in the following registry key:</para>
      <code>
        <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</b>
        <b>SOFTWARE</b>
        <b>Microsoft</b>
        <b>Windows NT</b>

        <b>Time Zones</b>
        <i>time_zone_name</i>
        <b>Dynamic DST</b>
