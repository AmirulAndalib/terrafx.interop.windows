      <para>One of the following <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/Stg/stgm-constants">STGM</a> values that indicates the access mode for <i>pstream</i>.</para>
      <h4>STGM_READ</h4>
      <para>The stream indicated by <i>pstream</i> is read-only.</para>
      <h4>STGM_READWRITE</h4>
      <para>The stream indicated by <i>pstream</i> is read/write accessible.</para>

      <para>Type: <b>HRESULT</b></para>
      <para>If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.</para>
    </returns>
    <remarks>
      <para>This method is preferred to <see cref="Initialize" /> due to its ability to use streams that are not accessible through a Win32 path, such as the contents of a compressed file with a .zip file name extension.</para>
      <para>The stream pointed to by <i>pstream</i> must remain open for the lifetime of the handler or until <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/bb761470(v=vs.85)">IPropertyStore.Commit</a> is called.</para>
      <para>When first opened, the source stream reference points to the beginning of the stream. The handler can seek and read from the stream at any time. A handler can be implemented to read all properties from the stream during <b>Initialize</b> or it can wait until the calling process attempts to enumerate or read properties before fetching them from the stream.</para>
      <para>A handler instance should be initialized only once in its lifetime. Attempts by the caller to reinitialize the handler should result in the error <code>HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_ALREADY_INITIALIZED)</code>.</para>
