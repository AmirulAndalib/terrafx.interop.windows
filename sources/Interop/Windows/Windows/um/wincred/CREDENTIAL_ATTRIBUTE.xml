    <summary>
      <para>The <b>CREDENTIAL_ATTRIBUTE</b> structure contains an application-defined attribute of the credential. An attribute is a keyword-value pair. It is up to the application to define the meaning of the attribute.</para>

    <remarks>
      <blockquote>
        <para>[!NOTE]
The wincred.h header defines CREDENTIAL_ATTRIBUTE as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors.
