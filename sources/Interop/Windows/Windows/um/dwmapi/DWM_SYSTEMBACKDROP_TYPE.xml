  <member name="DWM_SYSTEMBACKDROP_TYPE">
    <summary>Flags for specifying the system-drawn backdrop material of a window, including behind the non-client area.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DWM_SYSTEMBACKDROP_TYPE.DWMSBT_AUTO">
    <summary>
      <para>The default. Let the Desktop Window Manager (DWM) automatically decide the system-drawn backdrop material for this window. This applies the backdrop material just behind the default Win32 title bar. This behavior attempts to preserve maximum backwards compatibility. For this reason, the DWM might also decide to draw no backdrop material at all based on internal heuristics.</para>
      <para>If drawing the backdrop material behind the entire window is required, choose one of the other more specific values of this enum as appropriate.</para>
