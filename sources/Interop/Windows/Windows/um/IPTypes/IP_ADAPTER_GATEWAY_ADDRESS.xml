  <member name="IP_ADAPTER_GATEWAY_ADDRESS">
    <summary>
      <para>The
<b>IP_ADAPTER_GATEWAY_ADDRESS</b> structure stores a single gateway address in a linked list of gateway addresses for a particular adapter.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>The <see cref="IP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES" /> structure is retrieved by the <see cref="GetAdaptersAddresses" /> function. The <b>FirstGatewayAddress</b> member of the <b>IP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES</b> structure is a pointer to a linked list of <b>IP_ADAPTER_GATEWAY_ADDRESS</b> structures.</para>
      <para>The <see cref="SOCKET_ADDRESS" /> structure is used in the <b>IP_ADAPTER_GATEWAY_ADDRESS</b> structure. On the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) released for Windows Vista and later, the organization of header files has changed and the <b>SOCKET_ADDRESS</b> structure is defined in the <i>Ws2def.h</i> header file which is automatically included by the <i>Winsock2.h</i> header file. On the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) released for Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP, the <b>SOCKET_ADDRESS</b> structure is declared in the <i>Winsock2.h</i> header file. In order to use the <b>IP_ADAPTER_GATEWAY_ADDRESS</b> structure, the <i>Winsock2.h</i> header file must be included before the <i>Iphlpapi.h</i> header file.</para>
