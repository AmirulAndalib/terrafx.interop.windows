      <para>The
<b>IP_ADAPTER_UNICAST_ADDRESS</b> structure stores a single unicast IP address in a linked list of IP addresses for a particular adapter.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>The <see cref="IP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES" /> structure is retrieved by the <see cref="GetAdaptersAddresses" /> function. The <b>FirstUnicastAddress</b> member of the <b>IP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES</b> structure is a pointer to a linked list of <b>IP_ADAPTER_UNICAST_ADDRESS</b> structures.</para>
      <para>The size of the <b>IP_ADAPTER_UNICAST_ADDRESS</b> structure changed on Windows Vista and later. The <b>Length</b> member should be used to determine which version of the <b>IP_ADAPTER_UNICAST_ADDRESS</b> structure is being used.</para>
      <para>The version of the <b>IP_ADAPTER_UNICAST_ADDRESS</b> structure on Windows Vista and later has the following new member added: <b>OnLinkPrefixLength</b>.</para>
      <para>When this structure is used with the <see cref="GetAdaptersAddresses" /> function and similar management functions, all configured addresses are shown, including duplicate addresses. Such duplicate address entries can occur when addresses are configured statically. Such reporting facilitates administrator troubleshooting. The <b>DadState</b> member is effective in identifying and troubleshooting such situations.</para>
      <para>In the Windows SDK, the version of the structure for use on Windows Vista and later is  defined as <b>IP_ADAPTER_UNICAST_ADDRESS_LH</b>. In the Windows SDK, the version of this structure to be used on earlier systems including Windows XP with Service Pack 1 (SP1) and later is defined as <b>IP_ADAPTER_UNICAST_ADDRESS_XP</b>. When compiling an application if the target platform is Windows Vista and later (<code>NTDDI_VERSION &gt;= NTDDI_VISTA</code>, <code>_WIN32_WINNT &gt;= 0x0600</code>, or <code>WINVER &gt;= 0x0600</code>), the <b>IP_ADAPTER_UNICAST_ADDRESS_LH</b> structure is typedefed to the <b>IP_ADAPTER_UNICAST_ADDRESS</b> structure. When compiling an application if the target platform is not Windows Vista and later, the <b>IP_ADAPTER_UNICAST_ADDRESS_XP</b> structure is typedefed to the <b>IP_ADAPTER_UNICAST_ADDRESS</b> structure.</para>
      <para>The <see cref="SOCKET_ADDRESS" /> structure is used in the <b>IP_ADAPTER_UNICAST_ADDRESS</b> structure. On the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) released for Windows Vista and later, the organization of header files has changed and the <b>SOCKET_ADDRESS</b> structure is defined in the <i>Ws2def.h</i> header file which is automatically included by the <i>Winsock2.h</i> header file. On the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) released for Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP, the <b>SOCKET_ADDRESS</b> structure is declared in the <i>Winsock2.h</i> header file. In order to use the <b>IP_ADAPTER_UNICAST_ADDRESS</b> structure, the <i>Winsock2.h</i> header file must be included before the <i>Iphlpapi.h</i> header file.</para>
