      <para>The <b>TS_SELECTIONSTYLE</b> structure represents the style of a selection.</para>

    <remarks>
      <para>An interim character selection is the length of one character and is visually represented as a solid rectangle that is usually flashing. This is a standard UI element of Korean and some Chinese character compositions. <b>fInterimChar</b> is an indication that a specific character is being composed. <b>fInterimChar</b> can only be nonzero for a single selection. In this case, there will be no caret because the highlight takes its place.</para>
