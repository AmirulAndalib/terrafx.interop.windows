    <summary>Burns the staged image to media in the active disc recorder.</summary>
    <param name="bSimulate">Indicates whether the media is burned. If this parameter is <b>TRUE</b>, media in the active disc recorder is not actually burned. Instead, a simulated burn is performed. The simulation is a good test of a disc recorder, because most of the operations are performed as in a real burn. If this parameter is <b>FALSE</b>, then the media in the recorder is actually burned.</param>
    <param name="bEjectAfterBurn">Indicates whether to eject the media after the burn. If this parameter is <b>TRUE</b>, the media is ejected. If this parameter is <b>FALSE</b>, the media is not ejected.</param>

    <summary>The<b>IDiscMaster</b> interface allows an application to reserve an image mastering API, enumerate disc mastering formats and disc recorders supported by an image mastering object, and start a simulated or actual burn of a disc. Although an image mastering object can support several formats, it may not be possible to access all formats through a specific recorder. For this reason, you must select a recorder with<see cref="SetActiveDiscRecorder" /> after selecting a format with<see cref="SetActiveDiscMasterFormat" />.</summary>
