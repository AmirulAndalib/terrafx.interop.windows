  <member name="IJolietDiscMaster.AddData">
    <summary>Adds the contents of a root storage to the staged image file. This storage will be enumerated to place all substorages and streams in the root file system of the stage image file. Substorages become folders and streams become files. Multiple calls to this method can be repeated to slowly stage an image file without wasting undue amounts of hard drive space building up a storage file.</summary>
    <param name="pStorage">Path to the storage whose subitems are to be added to the root of the staged image file.</param>
    <param name="lFileOverwrite">If this parameter is nonzero, overwrite existing files with the same name. Otherwise, the last file added appears in the directory.</param>
    <returns>S_OK is returned on success, but other success codes may be returned as a result of implementation. The following error codes are commonly returned on operation failure, but do not represent the only possible error values:</returns>

    <summary>Retrieves the size of a data block.</summary>
    <param name="pnBlockBytes">Total size of a single data block, in bytes.</param>
    <returns>S_OK is returned on success, but other success codes may be returned as a result of implementation. The following error codes are commonly returned on operation failure, but do not represent the only possible error values:</returns>

  <member name="IJolietDiscMaster.GetJolietProperties">
    <summary>Retrieves a pointer to an<see cref="IPropertyStorage" /> interface that contains the Joliet properties.</summary>
    <param name="ppPropStg">Address of a pointer to an<see cref="IPropertyStorage" /> interface for the Joliet property set with all current properties defined.</param>
    <returns>S_OK is returned on success, but other success codes may be returned as a result of implementation. The following error codes are commonly returned on operation failure, but do not represent the only possible error values:</returns>

  <member name="IJolietDiscMaster.GetTotalDataBlocks">
    <summary>Retrieves the total number of blocks available for staging a Joliet data disc. The data returned from this method is valid only after a<see cref="SetActiveDiscRecorder" /> call, especially in a multi-session burn.</summary>
    <param name="pnBlocks">Total number of data blocks available on a disc.</param>
    <returns>S_OK is returned on success, but other success codes may be returned as a result of implementation. The following error codes are commonly returned on operation failure, but do not represent the only possible error values:</returns>

    <summary>Retrieves the total number of data blocks that are in use. The data returned from this method is valid only after a<see cref="SetActiveDiscRecorder" /> call, especially in a multi-session burn.</summary>
    <param name="pnBlocks">Total number of data blocks in use in the staged image.</param>

    <summary>Sets the Joliet properties.</summary>
    <param name="pPropStg">Pointer to the<see cref="IPropertyStorage" /> interface that the Joliet interface can use to retrieve new settings on various properties.</param>
    <returns>S_OK is returned on success, but other success codes may be returned as a result of implementation. The following error codes are commonly returned on operation failure, but do not represent the only possible error values:</returns>

    <summary>
      <para>The<b>IJolietDiscMaster</b> interface enables the staging of a CD data disc. It represents one of the formats supported by <b>MSDiscMasterObj</b>, and it allows the creation of a single Track-at-Once data disc. The data is written to the disc with the Joliet and ISO-9660 file systems.</para>
      <para>A temporary folder is constructed and added to the image. This can be repeated multiple times with the directory and file structures overlapping. The overlapping file structures appear seamlessly when read back. When the overwrite option is used, overlapping paths cause the last file added to show up in the directory, while the earlier files with conflicting names are still present on the disc but now not readable by normal means.</para>
