  <member name="IRedbookDiscMaster.AddAudioTrackBlocks">
    <summary>Adds blocks of audio data to the currently open track. This method can be called repeatedly until there is no space available or the track is full.</summary>
    <param name="pby">Pointer to an array of track blocks. The format is 44.1 KHz 16-bit stereo RAW audio samples, in the same format as used by WAV in the data section.</param>
    <param name="cb">Size of the array, in bytes. This count must be a multiple of the audio block size.</param>
    <returns>S_OK is returned on success, but other success codes may be returned as a result of implementation. The following error codes are commonly returned on operation failure, but do not represent the only possible error values:</returns>

  <member name="IRedbookDiscMaster.CloseAudioTrack">
    <summary>Closes a currently open audio track. All audio tracks must be closed before the<see cref="IDiscMaster.RecordDisc" /> method can be called.</summary>
    <returns>S_OK is returned on success, but other success codes may be returned as a result of implementation. The following error codes are commonly returned on operation failure, but do not represent the only possible error values:</returns>

    <summary>Begins staging a new audio track. It can be called only when there are no open audio tracks in the image.</summary>
    <param name="nBlocks">
      <para>Number of audio blocks to be added to this track. You can create up to 99 tracks, and the open track may consume all remaining available audio blocks.</para>
      <para>The <i>nBlocks</i> parameter is advisory only. It does not force the track length to this size.</para>

  <member name="IRedbookDiscMaster.GetTotalAudioBlocks">
    <summary>Retrieves the total number of blocks available for staging audio tracks. The total includes all block types, including blocks that may need to be allocated for track gaps.</summary>

    <summary>
      <para>The<b>IRedbookDiscMaster</b> interface enables the staging of an audio CD image. It represents one of the formats supported by <b>MSDiscMasterObj</b>, and it allows the creation of multi-track audio discs in Track-at-Once mode (fixed-size audio gaps).</para>
      <para>Tracks are created in the stash file, data is added to them, and then they are closed. Only one track is staged at a time; this is called the <i>open track</i>. The remaining tracks are closed and committed to the image, while the open track has available to it all the blocks that are not in use by closed tracks.</para>
