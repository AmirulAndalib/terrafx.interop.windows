      <para>S_OK is returned on success, but other success codes may be returned as a result of implementation. The following error codes are commonly returned on operation failure, but do not represent the only possible error values:</para>

      <para>After all blocks are added, call the
<see cref="CloseAudioTrack" /> method to finish the track.</para>
      <para>If a call to this method would overrun the number of available audio blocks, then the method will return IMAPI_E_DISCFULL and keep as much of the audio data as it can. In contrast, the
<see cref="IJolietDiscMaster.AddData" /> method does not keep any of the data, so there are no bad files.</para>

      <para>The
<b>IRedbookDiscMaster</b> interface enables the staging of an audio CD image. It represents one of the formats supported by <b>MSDiscMasterObj</b>, and it allows the creation of multi-track audio discs in Track-at-Once mode (fixed-size audio gaps).</para>
      <para>Tracks are created in the stash file, data is added to them, and then they are closed. Only one track is staged at a time; this is called the <i>open track</i>. The remaining tracks are closed and committed to the image, while the open track has available to it all the blocks that are not in use by closed tracks.</para>
