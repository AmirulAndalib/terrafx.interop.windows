    <summary>Activation of the handler is not supported at the time of the call. This value can be used by a handler to implement support for group policy that prevents the handler from being activated. If this value is set, the <b>Setup</b> task is not be shown in the Setup Sync folder when this handler is selected. The handler should provide a comment—returned from its implementation of <see cref="ISyncMgrHandlerInfo.GetComment" />—to let the user know why the <b>Setup</b> task is not available. Most handlers should not set this value.</summary>
