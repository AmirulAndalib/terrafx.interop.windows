    <summary>Enabling of the item is not supported at the time of the call. This value can be used by an item to implement support for group policy that prevents the item from being enabled. If this value is set, the <b>Enable</b> task is not shown in the handler's folder when this item is selected. The item should provide a comment—returned from its implementation of <see cref="ISyncMgrSyncItemInfo.GetComment" />—to let the user know why the <b>Enable</b> task is not available. Most items should not set this value.</summary>

  <member name="SYNCMGR_ITEM_POLICIES.SYNCMGR_IPM_PREVENT_START_SYNC">

If this value is set, then the Start Sync task will not be shown in the handler's folder when the sync item is selected. Note that Start Sync must be supported on a handler in order for it to be supported on a sync item. Most sync items should not set this value.</summary>

    <summary>Stopping a sync through the user interface or through the APIs is not supported. If this value is set, the Stop Sync task is not shown in the handler's folder when the sync item is selected.
