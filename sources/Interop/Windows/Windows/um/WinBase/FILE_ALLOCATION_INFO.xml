    <summary>
      <para>Contains the total number of bytes that should be allocated for a file. This structure is used when calling the <see cref="SetFileInformationByHandle" /> function.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>The end-of-file (EOF) position for a file must always be less than or equal to the file allocation size. If the allocation size is set to a value that is less than EOF, the EOF position is automatically adjusted to match the file allocation size.</para>
