  <member name="FILE_FULL_DIR_INFO">
    <summary>
      <para>Contains directory information for a file. This structure is returned from the
<see cref="GetFileInformationByHandleEx" /> function when
<b>FileFullDirectoryInfo</b> or <b>FileFullDirectoryRestartInfo</b> is
passed in the <i>FileInformationClass</i> parameter.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>The <b>FILE_FULL_DIR_INFO</b> structure is a subset of the
information in the <see cref="FILE_ID_BOTH_DIR_INFO" /> structure.
If the additional information is not needed then the operation will be faster as it comes from the directory
entry; <b>FILE_ID_BOTH_DIR_INFO</b> contains information
from both the directory entry and the Master File Table (MFT).</para>
      <para>No specific access rights are required to
query this information.</para>
      <para>All dates and times are in absolute system-time format. Absolute system time is the number of 100-nanosecond
intervals since the start of the year 1601.</para>
      <para>This <b>FILE_FULL_DIR_INFO</b> structure must be aligned
on a <b>LONGLONG</b> (8-byte) boundary. If a buffer contains two or more of these
structures, the <b>NextEntryOffset</b> value in each entry, except the last, falls on an
8-byte boundary.</para>
      <para>To compile an application that uses this structure, define the <b>_WIN32_WINNT</b> macro
as 0x0600 or later. For more information, see

  <member name="FILE_FULL_DIR_INFO.NextEntryOffset">
    <summary>
      <para>The offset for the next <b>FILE_FULL_DIR_INFO</b></para>
      <para>structure that is returned. Contains zero (0) if no other entries follow this one.</para>
    </summary>
  </member>
  <member name="FILE_FULL_DIR_INFO.FileIndex">
    <summary>
      <para>The byte offset of the file within the parent directory. This member is undefined for file systems, such as
NTFS, in which the position of a file within the parent directory is not fixed and can be changed at any time to
maintain sort order.</para>

      <para>The time that the file was created.</para>

  <member name="FILE_FULL_DIR_INFO.EndOfFile">
    <summary>
      <para>The absolute new end-of-file position as a byte offset from the start of the file to the end of the default
data stream of the file. Because this value is zero-based, it actually refers to the first free byte in the
file. In other words, <b>EndOfFile</b> is the offset to the byte that immediately follows
the last valid byte in the file.</para>
    </summary>
  </member>
  <member name="FILE_FULL_DIR_INFO.AllocationSize">
    <summary>
      <para>The number of bytes that are allocated for the file. This value is usually a multiple of the sector or
cluster size of the underlying physical device.</para>

  <member name="FILE_FULL_DIR_INFO.FileAttributes">
    <summary>
      <para>The file attributes. This member can be any valid combination of the following attributes:</para>
