  <member name="FILE_FULL_DIR_INFO">

  </member>
  <member name="FILE_FULL_DIR_INFO.NextEntryOffset">
    <summary>The offset for the next <b>FILE_FULL_DIR_INFO</b>structure that is returned. Contains zero (0) if no other entries follow this one.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="FILE_FULL_DIR_INFO.FileIndex">
    <summary>The byte offset of the file within the parent directory. This member is undefined for file systems, such as NTFS, in which the position of a file within the parent directory is not fixed and can be changed at any time to maintain sort order.</summary>

  <member name="FILE_FULL_DIR_INFO.EndOfFile">
    <summary>The absolute new end-of-file position as a byte offset from the start of the file to the end of the default data stream of the file. Because this value is zero-based, it actually refers to the first free byte in the file. In other words, <b>EndOfFile</b> is the offset to the byte that immediately follows the last valid byte in the file.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="FILE_FULL_DIR_INFO.AllocationSize">
    <summary>The number of bytes that are allocated for the file. This value is usually a multiple of the sector or cluster size of the underlying physical device.</summary>
