  <member name="AUDIO_VOLUME_NOTIFICATION_DATA">
    <summary>The <b>AUDIO_VOLUME_NOTIFICATION_DATA</b> structure describes a change in the volume level or muting state of an audio endpoint device.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="AUDIO_VOLUME_NOTIFICATION_DATA.guidEventContext">
    <summary>Context value for the <see cref="IAudioEndpointVolumeCallback.OnNotify" /> method. This member is the value of the event-context GUID that was provided as an input parameter to the <see cref="IAudioEndpointVolume" /> method call that changed the endpoint volume level or muting state. For more information, see Remarks.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="AUDIO_VOLUME_NOTIFICATION_DATA.bMuted">
    <summary>Specifies whether the audio stream is currently muted. If <b>bMuted</b> is <b>TRUE</b>, the stream is muted. If <b>FALSE</b>, the stream is not muted.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="AUDIO_VOLUME_NOTIFICATION_DATA.fMasterVolume">
    <summary>Specifies the current master volume level of the audio stream. The volume level is normalized to the range from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 is the minimum volume level and 1.0 is the maximum level. Within this range, the relationship of the normalized volume level to the attenuation of signal amplitude is described by a nonlinear, audio-tapered curve. For more information about audio tapers, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/CoreAudio/audio-tapered-volume-controls">Audio-Tapered Volume Controls</a>.</summary>

  <member name="AUDIO_VOLUME_NOTIFICATION_DATA.nChannels">
    <summary>Specifies the number of channels in the audio stream, which is also the number of elements in the <b>afChannelVolumes</b> array. If the audio stream contains <i>n</i> channels, the channels are numbered from 0 to <i>n</i>-1. The volume level for a particular channel is contained in the array element whose index matches the channel number.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="AUDIO_VOLUME_NOTIFICATION_DATA.afChannelVolumes">
    <summary>The first element in an array of channel volumes. This element contains the current volume level of channel 0 in the audio stream. If the audio stream contains more than one channel, the volume levels for the additional channels immediately follow the <b>AUDIO_VOLUME_NOTIFICATION_DATA</b> structure. The volume level for each channel is normalized to the range from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 is the minimum volume level and 1.0 is the maximum level. Within this range, the relationship of the normalized volume level to the attenuation of signal amplitude is described by a nonlinear, audio-tapered curve.</summary>
