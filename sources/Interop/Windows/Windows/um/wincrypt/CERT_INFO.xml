    <summary>
      <para>A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/SecGloss/b-gly">BLOB</a> that contains the serial number of a certificate. The least significant byte is the zero byte of the <b>pbData</b> member of <i>SerialNumber</i>. The index for the last byte of <b>pbData</b>, is one less than the value of the <b>cbData</b> member of <i>SerialNumber</i>. The most significant byte is the last byte of <b>pbData</b>.
