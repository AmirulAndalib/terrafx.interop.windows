  <member name="CERT_INFO.SerialNumber">
    <summary>A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/SecGloss/b-gly">BLOB</a> that contains the serial number of a certificate. The least significant byte is the zero byte of the <b>pbData</b> member of <i>SerialNumber</i>. The index for the last byte of <b>pbData</b>, is one less than the value of the <b>cbData</b> member of <i>SerialNumber</i>. The most significant byte is the last byte of <b>pbData</b>. Leading 0x00 or 0xFF bytes are removed. For more information, see <see cref="CertCompareIntegerBlob" />.</summary>

  </member>
  <member name="CERT_INFO.NotBefore">
    <summary>Date and time before which the certificate is not valid. For dates between 1950 and 2049 inclusive, the date and time is encoded Coordinated Universal Time (Greenwich Mean Time) format in the form YYMMDDHHMMSS. This member uses a two-digit year and is precise to seconds. For dates before 1950 or after 2049, encoded generalized time is used. Encoded generalized time is in the form YYYYMMDDHHMMSSMMM, using a four-digit year, and is precise to milliseconds. Even though generalized time supports millisecond resolution, the <b>NotBefore</b> time is only precise to seconds.</summary>

    <summary>Date and time after which the certificate is not valid. For dates between 1950 and 2049 inclusive, the date and time is encoded Coordinated Universal Time format in the form YYMMDDHHMMSS. This member uses a two-digit year and is precise to seconds. For dates before 1950 or after 2049, encoded generalized time is used. Encoded generalized time is in the form YYYYMMDDHHMMSSMMM, using a four-digit year, and is precise to milliseconds.
