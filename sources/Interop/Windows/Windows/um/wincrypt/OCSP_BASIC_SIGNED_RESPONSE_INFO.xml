    <summary>
      <para>The <b>OCSP_BASIC_SIGNED_RESPONSE_INFO</b> structure contains a basic <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/SecGloss/o-gly">online certificate status protocol</a> (OCSP) response with a signature.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>In an OCSP responder service, this structure receives an encoded <see cref="OCSP_BASIC_RESPONSE_INFO" /> structure as its <b>ToBeSigned</b> member. The signature  of the <b>ToBeSigned</b>  member is stored in the <b>SignatureInfo</b> member. The encoded <b>OCSP_BASIC_SIGNED_RESPONSE_INFO</b> structure is stored in an <see cref="OCSP_RESPONSE_INFO" /> structure.</para>
      <para>On the receiving end, an OCSP client application must decode the <see cref="OCSP_RESPONSE_INFO" /><b>Value</b> member to obtain this structure and subsequently decode the <b>OCSP_BASIC_SIGNED_RESPONSE_INFO</b><b>ToBeSigned</b> member to obtain an <see cref="OCSP_BASIC_RESPONSE_INFO" /> structure.</para>
      <para>OCSP applications can encode or decode this structure by using <b>X509_ASN_ENCODING</b> or <b>PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING</b>.</para>
