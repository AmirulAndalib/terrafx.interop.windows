  <member name="CERT_REVOCATION_PARA">
    <summary>The <b>CERT_REVOCATION_PARA</b> structure is passed in calls to the <see cref="CertVerifyRevocation" /> function to assist in finding the issuer of the context to be verified. The <b>CERT_REVOCATION_PARA</b> structure is an optional parameter in the <see cref="CertVerifyRevocation" /> function.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="CERT_REVOCATION_PARA.cbSize">
    <summary>The size, in bytes, of this structure.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="CERT_REVOCATION_PARA.pIssuerCert">
    <summary>A pointer to a<see cref="CERT_CONTEXT" /> structure that contains the certificate of the issuer of a certificate specified in the <i>rgpvContext</i> array in the<see cref="CertVerifyRevocation" /> parameter list.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="CERT_REVOCATION_PARA.cCertStore">
    <summary>When set, contains the number of elements in the <b>rgCertStore</b> array. Set to zero if you are not supplying a list of store handles in the <i>rgCertStore</i> parameter.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="CERT_REVOCATION_PARA.rgCertStore">
    <summary>An array of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">certificate store</a> handles. Specifies a set of stores that are searched for issuer certificates. If <i>rgCertStore</i> is not set, the default stores are searched.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="CERT_REVOCATION_PARA.hCrlStore">
    <summary>Optional store handle. When specified, a handler that uses <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">certificate revocation lists</a> (CRLs) can search this store for CRLs.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="CERT_REVOCATION_PARA.pftTimeToUse">
    <summary>A pointer to a <b>FILETIME</b> version of UTC time. When specified, the handler must, if possible, determine revocation status relative to the time given. If <b>NULL</b> or the handler cannot determine the status relative to the <b>pftTimeToUse</b> value, revocation status can be determined independent of time or relative to current time.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="CERT_REVOCATION_PARA.dwUrlRetrievalTimeout">
    <summary>This member is defined only if <b>CERT_REVOCATION_PARA_HAS_EXTRA_FIELDS</b> is defined. The time-out, in milliseconds, that the revocation handler will wait when attempting to retrieve revocation information. If it is set to zero, the revocation handler's default time-out is used. If <b>CERT_REVOCATION_PARA_HAS_EXTRA_FIELDS</b> is defined, this member must be set to zero if it is unused.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="CERT_REVOCATION_PARA.fCheckFreshnessTime">
    <summary>This member is defined only if <b>CERT_REVOCATION_PARA_HAS_EXTRA_FIELDS</b> is defined. If <b>TRUE</b>, an attempt is made to retrieve a new CRL if the issue date of the CRL is less than or equal to the Current Time minus <b>dwFreshnessTime</b>. If this flag is not set, the CRL's NextUpdate time is used. If <b>CERT_REVOCATION_PARA_HAS_EXTRA_FIELDS</b> is defined, this member must be set to <b>FALSE</b> if it is unused.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="CERT_REVOCATION_PARA.dwFreshnessTime">
    <summary>This member is defined only if <b>CERT_REVOCATION_PARA_HAS_EXTRA_FIELDS</b> is defined. The time, in seconds, is used to determine whether an attempt will be made to retrieve a new CRL. If <b>CERT_REVOCATION_PARA_HAS_EXTRA_FIELDS</b> is defined, this member must be set to zero if it is unused.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="CERT_REVOCATION_PARA.pftCurrentTime">
    <summary>This member is defined only if <b>CERT_REVOCATION_PARA_HAS_EXTRA_FIELDS</b> is defined. A pointer to a <b>FILETIME</b> structure that is used in the freshness time check. If the value of this pointer is null, the revocation handler uses the current time. If <b>CERT_REVOCATION_PARA_HAS_EXTRA_FIELDS</b> is defined, this member must be set to null if it is unused.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="CERT_REVOCATION_PARA.pCrlInfo">
    <summary>This member is defined only if <b>CERT_REVOCATION_PARA_HAS_EXTRA_FIELDS</b> is defined. This member contains a pointer to a PCERT_REVOCATION_CRL_INFO structure that contains CRL context information. The CRL information is only applicable to the last <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">context</a> checked. To access the information in this CRL, call the <see cref="CertVerifyRevocation" /> function with <i>cContext</i> set to 1. If <b>CERT_REVOCATION_PARA_HAS_EXTRA_FIELDS</b> is defined, the member must be set to null if it is unused.</summary>

    <summary>
      <para>This member is defined only if <b>CERT_REVOCATION_PARA_HAS_EXTRA_FIELDS</b> is defined. This member contains a pointer to a <b>FILETIME</b> structure that specifies the use of cached information. Any information cached before the specified time is considered invalid and new information is retrieved. If <b>CERT_REVOCATION_PARA_HAS_EXTRA_FIELDS</b> is defined, this member must be set to null if it is unused.</para>

      <para>This member is defined only if <b>CERT_REVOCATION_PARA_HAS_EXTRA_FIELDS</b> is defined. This member contains a pointer to a <see cref="CERT_REVOCATION_CHAIN_PARA" /> structure that contains parameters used for building a chain for an independent OCSP signer certificate.
