    <summary>
      <para>The <b>CERT_REVOCATION_PARA</b> structure is passed in calls to
the <see cref="CertVerifyRevocation" /> function to assist in finding the issuer of the context to be verified. The <b>CERT_REVOCATION_PARA</b> structure is an optional parameter in the <see cref="CertVerifyRevocation" /> function.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>The <b>CERT_REVOCATION_PARA</b> structure provides additional information that the <see cref="CertVerifyRevocation" /> function can use to determine the context issuer.</para>
      <para>If your application must check the freshness of the CRL or resynchronize the CRL cache, you can provide extra structure members to assist  the <see cref="CertVerifyRevocation" /> function with this.  To include the additional structure members, define the constant <b>CERT_REVOCATION_PARA_HAS_EXTRA_FIELDS</b> in your application before including Wincrypt.h</para>

    <summary>
      <para>An array of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">certificate store</a> handles. Specifies a set of stores that are searched for issuer certificates.  If <i>rgCertStore</i> is not set, the default stores are searched.</para>

    <summary>
      <para>Optional store handle. When specified, a handler that uses <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">certificate revocation lists</a> (CRLs) can search this store for CRLs.</para>

  <member name="CERT_REVOCATION_PARA.pftTimeToUse">
    <summary>
      <para>A pointer to a <b>FILETIME</b> version of UTC time. When specified, the handler must, if possible, determine revocation status relative to the time given. If <b>NULL</b> or the handler cannot determine the status relative to the <b>pftTimeToUse</b> value, revocation status can be determined independent of time or relative to current time.</para>

    <summary>
      <para>This member is defined only if <b>CERT_REVOCATION_PARA_HAS_EXTRA_FIELDS</b> is defined. The time-out, in milliseconds, that the revocation handler will wait when attempting to retrieve revocation information. If it is set to zero, the revocation handler's default time-out is used.

    <summary>
      <para>This member is defined only if <b>CERT_REVOCATION_PARA_HAS_EXTRA_FIELDS</b> is defined.
