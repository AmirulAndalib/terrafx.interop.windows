    <summary>A handle to the CNG CSP used to do the recipient key encryption and export. The CNG function <see cref="NCryptIsKeyHandle" /> is called to determine the union choice. New encrypt algorithms are only supported in CNG functions. The CNG function <see cref="NCryptTranslateHandle" /> will be called to convert the CryptoAPI CSP <i>hCryptProv</i> choice where necessary. We recommend that applications pass, to the <i>hNCryptKey</i> member, the CNG CSP handle that is returned from the <see cref="NCryptOpenKey" /> function.</summary>
