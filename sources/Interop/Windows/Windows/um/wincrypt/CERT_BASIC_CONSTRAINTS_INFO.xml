    <summary>
      <para>The <b>CERT_BASIC_CONSTRAINTS_INFO</b> structure contains information that indicates whether the certified subject can act as a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly">certification authority</a> (CA), an end entity, or both. If the subject can act as a CA, a certification path-length constraint can also be specified, as can a set of subtrees that must contain all subject names of subsequent certificates in a certification chain. This extension is used in validating certificates used to sign other certificates.</para>
      <para>The <see cref="CryptDecodeObject" /> function creates an instance of this structure when performed on a<see cref="CERT_EXTENSION" /> structure's <b>Value</b> member with its structure's <b>pszObjId</b> member set to szOID_BASIC_CONSTRAINTS.</para>
