    <summary>
      <para>The <b>CERT_PRIVATE_KEY_VALIDITY</b> structure indicates a valid time span for the private key corresponding to a certificate's public key. If the <b>NotBefore</b> component is zero or not present, no statement is made as to when the validity period of the private key begins. If the <b>NotAfter</b> component is zero or not present, no end date is set on the validity of the private key.</para>
      <para>A <b>CERT_PRIVATE_KEY_VALIDITY</b> structure is a member of the<see cref="CERT_KEY_ATTRIBUTES_INFO" /> structure.</para>

  <member name="CERT_PRIVATE_KEY_VALIDITY.NotBefore">
    <summary>Date and time before which the certificate is not valid. For dates between 1950 and 2049 inclusive, the date and time is encoded UTC-time in the form YYMMDDHHMMSS. This member uses a two-digit year and is precise to seconds. For dates before 1950 or after 2049, encoded generalized-time is used. Encoded generalized time is in the form YYYYMMDDHHMMSSMMM, using a four-digit year, and is precise to milliseconds. Even though generalized time supports millisecond resolution, the <b>NotBefore</b> time is only precise to seconds.</summary>
