    <summary>The <b>PartType</b> enumeration defines constants that indicate whether a part in a device topology is a connector or subunit.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="PartType.Connector">
    <summary>The part is a connector. A connector can represent an audio jack, an internal connection to an integrated endpoint device, or a software connection implemented through DMA transfers. For more information about connector types, see <see cref="ConnectorType Enumeration" />.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="PartType.Subunit">
    <summary>The part is a subunit. A subunit is an audio-processing node in a device topology. A subunit frequently has one or more hardware control parameters that can be set under program control. For example, an audio application can change the volume setting of a volume-control subunit.</summary>
