    <summary>
      <para>The <b>IAudioMidrange</b> interface provides access to a hardware midrange-level control. The client obtains a reference to the <b>IAudioMidrange</b> interface of a subunit by calling the <see cref="IPart.Activate" /> method with parameter <i>refiid</i> set to REFIID IID_IAudioMidrange. The call to <b>IPart.Activate</b> succeeds only if the subunit supports the <b>IAudioMidrange</b> interface. Only a subunit object that represents a hardware function for controlling the level of the mid-range frequencies in each channel will support this interface.</para>
      <para>The <b>IAudioMidrange</b> interface provides per-channel controls for setting and getting the gain or attenuation level of the midrange frequencies in the audio stream. If a midrange-level hardware control can only attenuate the channels in the audio stream, then the maximum midrange level for any channel is 0 dB. If a midrange-level control can provide gain (amplification), then the maximum midrange level is greater than 0 dB.</para>
      <para>Most Windows audio adapter drivers support the Windows Driver Model (WDM) and use kernel-streaming (KS) properties to represent the hardware control parameters in subunits (referred to as KS nodes). The <b>IAudioMidrange</b> interface provides convenient access to the KSPROPERTY_AUDIO_MID property of a subunit that has a subtype GUID value of KSNODETYPE_TONE. To obtain the subtype GUID of a subunit, call the <see cref="IPart.GetSubType" /> method. For more information about KS properties and KS node types, see the Windows DDK documentation.</para>
