    <summary>
      <para>The <b>DataFlow</b> enumeration indicates the data-flow direction of an audio stream through a connector.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>The <see cref="IConnector.GetDataFlow" /> method uses the constants defined in the <b>DataFlow</b> enumeration.</para>
      <para>The topology of a rendering or capture device on an audio adapter typically has one or more connectors with a data-flow direction of "In" through which audio data enters the device, and one or more connectors with a data-flow direction of "Out" through which audio data exits the device. For example, a typical rendering device on an adapter has a connector with data-flow direction "In" through which the Windows audio engine streams PCM data into the device. The same device has a connector with data-flow direction "Out" through which the device transmits an audio signal to speakers or headphones.</para>
      <para>The topology of a rendering endpoint device (for example, headphones) has a single connector with data-flow direction "In" through which audio data (in the form of an analog signal) enters the device.</para>
      <para>The topology of a capture endpoint device (for example, a microphone) has a single connector with data-flow direction "Out" through which audio data exits the device.</para>
