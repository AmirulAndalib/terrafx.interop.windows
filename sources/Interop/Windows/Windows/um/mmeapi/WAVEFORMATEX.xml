  <member name="WAVEFORMATEX">
    <summary>
      <para>The <b>WAVEFORMATEX</b> structure defines the format of waveform-audio data. Only format information common to all waveform-audio data formats is included in this structure. For formats that require additional information, this structure is included as the first member in another structure, along with the additional information.</para>
      <para>Formats that support more than two channels or sample sizes of more than 16 bits can be described in a <see cref="WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE" /> structure, which includes the <see cref="WAVEFORMAT" /> structure.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>An example of a format that uses extra information is the Microsoft Adaptive Delta Pulse Code Modulation (MS-ADPCM) format. The <b>wFormatTag</b> for MS-ADPCM is WAVE_FORMAT_ADPCM. The <b>cbSize</b> member will typically be set to 32. The extra information stored for WAVE_FORMAT_ADPCM is coefficient pairs required for encoding and decoding the waveform-audio data.</para>

  <member name="WAVEFORMATEX.wFormatTag">
    <summary>
      <para>Waveform-audio format type. Format tags are registered with Microsoft Corporation for many compression algorithms. A complete list of format tags can be found in the Mmreg.h header file. For one- or two-channel PCM data, this value should be WAVE_FORMAT_PCM. When this structure is included in a <see cref="WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE" /> structure, this value must be WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE.</para>

  <member name="WAVEFORMATEX.nChannels">
    <summary>
      <para>Number of channels in the waveform-audio data. Monaural data uses one channel and stereo data uses two channels.</para>
    </summary>
  </member>
  <member name="WAVEFORMATEX.nSamplesPerSec">
    <summary>
      <para>Sample rate, in samples per second (hertz). If <b>wFormatTag</b> is WAVE_FORMAT_PCM, then common values for <b>nSamplesPerSec</b> are 8.0 kHz, 11.025 kHz, 22.05 kHz, and 44.1 kHz. For non-PCM formats, this member must be computed according to the manufacturer's specification of the format tag.</para>
    </summary>
  </member>
  <member name="WAVEFORMATEX.nAvgBytesPerSec">
    <summary>
      <para>Required average data-transfer rate, in bytes per second, for the format tag. If <b>wFormatTag</b> is WAVE_FORMAT_PCM, <b>nAvgBytesPerSec</b> should be equal to the product of <b>nSamplesPerSec</b> and <b>nBlockAlign</b>. For non-PCM formats, this member must be computed according to the manufacturer's specification of the format tag.</para>
    </summary>
  </member>
  <member name="WAVEFORMATEX.nBlockAlign">
    <summary>
      <para>Block alignment, in bytes. The block alignment is the minimum atomic unit of data for the <b>wFormatTag</b> format type. If <b>wFormatTag</b> is WAVE_FORMAT_PCM or WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE, <b>nBlockAlign</b> must be equal to the product of <b>nChannels</b> and <b>wBitsPerSample</b> divided by 8 (bits per byte). For non-PCM formats, this member must be computed according to the manufacturer's specification of the format tag.</para>
      <para>Software must process a multiple of <b>nBlockAlign</b> bytes of data at a time. Data written to and read from a device must always start at the beginning of a block. For example, it is illegal to start playback of PCM data in the middle of a sample (that is, on a non-block-aligned boundary).</para>
    </summary>
  </member>
  <member name="WAVEFORMATEX.wBitsPerSample">
    <summary>
      <para>Bits per sample for the <b>wFormatTag</b> format type. If <b>wFormatTag</b> is WAVE_FORMAT_PCM, then <b>wBitsPerSample</b> should be equal to 8 or 16. For non-PCM formats, this member must be set according to the manufacturer's specification of the format tag. If <b>wFormatTag</b> is WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE, this value can be any integer multiple of 8 and represents the container size, not necessarily the sample size; for example, a 20-bit sample size is in a 24-bit container. Some compression schemes cannot define a value for <b>wBitsPerSample</b>, so this member can be 0.</para>
    </summary>
  </member>
  <member name="WAVEFORMATEX.cbSize">
    <summary>
      <para>Size, in bytes, of extra format information appended to the end of the <b>WAVEFORMATEX</b> structure. This information can be used by non-PCM formats to store extra attributes for the <b>wFormatTag</b>. If no extra information is required by the <b>wFormatTag</b>, this member must be set to 0. For WAVE_FORMAT_PCM formats (and only WAVE_FORMAT_PCM formats), this member is ignored. When this structure is included in a <see cref="WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE" /> structure, this value must be at least 22.</para>
