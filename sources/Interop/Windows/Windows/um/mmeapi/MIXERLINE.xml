          <description>Audio line is a source originating from personal computer speaker. Several audio cards for personal computers provide the ability to mix what would typically be played on the internal speaker with the output of an audio card. Some audio cards support the ability to use this output as a recording source.</description>

          <description>Audio line is a destination that will be the final recording source for the waveform-audio input (ADC). This line typically provides some sort of gain or attenuation. This is the typical component type for the recording line of most audio cards for personal computers.</description>

          <description>Audio line is a line-level source (for example, line-level input from an external stereo) that can be used as an optional recording source. Because most audio cards for personal computers provide some sort of gain for the recording source line, the mixer device will use the MIXERLINE_COMPONENTTYPE_SRC_AUXILIARY type.</description>

          <description>Audio line is a microphone recording source. Most audio cards for personal computers provide at least two types of recording sources: an auxiliary audio line and microphone input. A microphone audio line typically provides some sort of gain. Audio cards that use a single input for use with a microphone or auxiliary audio line should use the MIXERLINE_COMPONENTTYPE_SRC_MICROPHONE component type.</description>
