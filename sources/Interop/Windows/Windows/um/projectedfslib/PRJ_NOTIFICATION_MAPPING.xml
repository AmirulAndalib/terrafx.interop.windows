    <summary>
      <para>Describes a notification mapping, which is a pairing between a directory (referred to as a "notification root") and a set of notifications, expressed as a bit mask.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>PRJ_NOTIFICATION_MAPPING describes a "notification mapping", which is a pairing between a directory (referred to as a "notification root") and a set of notifications, expressed as a bit mask, which ProjFS should send for that directory and its descendants. A notification mapping can also be established for a single file.</para>
      <para>The provider puts an array of zero or more PRJ_NOTIFICATION_MAPPING structures in the NotificationMappings member of the options parameter of PrjStartVirtualizing to configure notifications for the virtualization root.</para>
      <para>If the provider does not specify any notification mappings, ProjFS will default to sending the notifications PRJ_NOTIFICATION_FILE_OPENED, PRJ_NOTIFICATION_NEW_FILE_CREATED, and PRJ_NOTIFICATION_FILE_OVERWRITTEN for all files and directories in the virtualization instance.</para>
      <para>The directory or file is specified relative to the virtualization root, with an empty string representing the virtualization root itself.</para>
      <para>If the provider specifies multiple notification mappings, and some are descendants of others, the mappings must be specified in descending depth. Notification mappings at deeper levels override higher-level ones for their descendants.</para>
