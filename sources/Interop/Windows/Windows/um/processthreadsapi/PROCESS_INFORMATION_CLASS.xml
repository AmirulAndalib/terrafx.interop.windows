  <member name="PROCESS_INFORMATION_CLASS.ProcessMemoryPriority">
    <summary>The process information is represented by a <see cref="MEMORY_PRIORITY_INFORMATION" /> structure. Allows applications to lower the default memory priority of threads that perform background operations or access files and data that are not expected to be accessed again soon.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="PROCESS_INFORMATION_CLASS.ProcessMemoryExhaustionInfo">
    <summary>The process information is represented by a <see cref="PROCESS_MEMORY_EXHAUSTION_INFO" /> structure. Allows applications to configure a process to terminate if an allocation fails to commit memory.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="PROCESS_INFORMATION_CLASS.ProcessAppMemoryInfo">
    <summary>The process information is represented by a <see cref="APP_MEMORY_INFORMATION" /> structure. Allows applications to query the commit usage and the additional commit available to this process. Does not allow the caller to actually get a commit limit.</summary>
