      <para>Indicates the mouse button state at the time of the event. See the <i>wParam</i> parameter of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/inputdev/wm-mousemove">WM_MOUSEMOVE</a> message for possible values.</para>

    <remarks>
      <para>The caller should translate double-click events into multiple mouse button down events. This enables a text service to detect double-click events even if the context window does not support double-clicks.</para>
      <para>
        <i>uEdge</i> contains the offset, in characters, of the mouse position from the start of the text range. The mouse position is always rounded to the closest edge. Each edge is divided into four equal quadrants with two quadrants preceding the edge and two quadrants following the edge. <i>uQuadrant</i> contains the zero-based quadrant index of the mouse position. In the figure below, point "X" is in quadrant 2 of edge 1 and point "Y" is in quadrant 1 of edge 3.</para>
