    <summary>
      <para>The <b>TF_SELECTIONSTYLE</b> structure represents the style of a selection.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>An interim character selection spans exactly one character and is visually represented as a solid rectangle that is usually flashing. This is a standard UI element of Korean and some Chinese character compositions. <b>fInterimChar</b> is an indication that a specific character is composed. <b>fInterimChar</b> can only be nonzero for a single selection. In this case, there will be no caret because the highlight replaces it.</para>
