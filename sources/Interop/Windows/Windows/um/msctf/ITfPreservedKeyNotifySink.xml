    <remarks>
      <para>To determine if the key is unpreserved, call <see cref="ITfKeystrokeMgr.IsPreservedKey" />, passing <i>pprekey</i>. If the key is not found, it is unpreserved. If the key is found, it is either preserved or the description has changed. Unless you keep track of the current key description and compare the previous description with the current description in response to this notification, there is no way to determine if this notification is in response to a key preserved or the description changed.</para>

    <summary>
      <para>The <b>ITfPreservedKeyNotifySink</b> interface is implemented by an application or TSF text service to receive notifications when keys are preserved, unpreserved, or when a preserved key description changes. This advise sink is installed by calling the TSF manager <see cref="ITfSource.AdviseSink" /> with IID_ITfPreservedKeyNotifySink.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>Preserved keys are keyboard shortcuts that an application or TSF text service can register with the TSF manager.</para>
