  <member name="MFASYNCRESULT.pCallback">
    <summary>
      <para>Pointer to the <see cref="IMFAsyncCallback" /> interface. This interface is implemented by the caller of the asynchronous method. This member can be <b>NULL</b>. If this member is <b>NULL</b>, the <b>hEvent</b> member must be a valid event handle.</para>

  <member name="MFASYNCRESULT.hrStatusResult">
    <summary>
      <para>The status code returned when this structure is used with an I/O completion port. You can also use this member to hold the status code for the asynchronous operation, returned by <see cref="IMFAsyncResult.GetStatus" />.</para>

  <member name="MFASYNCRESULT.dwBytesTransferred">
    <summary>
      <para>The number of bytes transferred when this structure is used with an I/O completion port. This member is used internally by the work queue. Set this member to zero.</para>

  <member name="MFASYNCRESULT.hEvent">
    <summary>
      <para>Event handle. If <b>pCallback</b> is <b>NULL</b>, set this member to a valid event handle. The event is signaled when the work item is dispatched. Otherwise, set this member to <b>NULL</b>.</para>
