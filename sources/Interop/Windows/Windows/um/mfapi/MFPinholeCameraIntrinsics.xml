    <summary>Contains zero or 1 pinhole camera intrinsic models that describe how to project a 3D point in physical world onto the 2D image frame of a camera. The conventions assumed by this structure imply a left-handed 3D coordinate system, with +X pointing to the right of the sensor, +Y pointing upwards from the sensor, and +Z pointing forward out of the sensor through the center (principal point) of the image.</summary>
