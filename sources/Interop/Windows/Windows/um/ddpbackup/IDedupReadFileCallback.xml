    <summary>
      <para>This method provides the application with the ability to influence the order of the pending reads that are required to retrieve the target file.</para>
      <para>Given a list of container files that hold data for the restore target file, generates a list of container file extents in a sorted order that results in an efficient cross-container read plan from the backup store.</para>
      <para>Implementation of this method by the application is optional.</para>
    </summary>
    <param name="NumberOfContainers">Number of container paths in the <i>ContainerPaths</i> array.</param>
    <param name="ContainerPaths">Array of paths to container files that must be read in order to restore the file specified in the<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/ddpbackup/nf-ddpbackup-idedupbackupsupport-restorefiles">IDedupBackupSupport.RestoreFiles</a>call. Each element is a full path from the root directory of the volume to a container file.</param>
    <param name="ReadPlanEntries">Pointer to a ULONG variable that receives the number of<see cref="DEDUP_CONTAINER_EXTENT" /> structures in the array that the <i>ReadPlan</i> parameter points to.</param>
    <param name="ReadPlan">Pointer to a buffer that receives an array of<see cref="DEDUP_CONTAINER_EXTENT" /> structures.</param>
    <returns>This method can return standard <b>HRESULT</b> values, such as<b>S_OK</b>. It can also return converted<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/Debug/system-error-codes">system error codes</a> using the<see cref="HRESULT_FROM_WIN32" /> macro. Possible return values include the following.</returns>

  <member name="IDedupReadFileCallback.PreviewContainerRead">
    <summary>Provides the application with a preview of the sequence of reads that are pending for a given container file extent.</summary>
    <param name="FileFullPath">The full path from the root directory of the volume to the container file.</param>
    <param name="NumberOfReads">Number of <see cref="DDP_FILE_EXTENT" /> structures in the array that the <i>ReadOffsets</i> parameter points to.</param>
    <param name="ReadOffsets">Pointer to an array of <see cref="DDP_FILE_EXTENT" /> structures.</param>
    <returns>This method can return standard <b>HRESULT</b> values, such as <b>S_OK</b>.

  <member name="IDedupReadFileCallback.ReadBackupFile">
    <summary>Reads data from a Data Deduplication store metadata or container file located in the backup store.</summary>
    <param name="FileFullPath">The full path from the root directory of the volume to the container file.</param>
    <param name="FileOffset">The offset, in bytes, from the beginning of the file to the beginning of the data to be read.</param>
    <param name="SizeToRead">The number of bytes to read from the file.</param>
    <param name="FileBuffer">A pointer to a buffer that receives the data that is read from the file. The size of the buffer must be greater than or equal to the number specified in the <i>SizeToRead</i> parameter.</param>
    <param name="ReturnedSize">Pointer to a ULONG variable that receives the number of bytes that were read from the backup store. If the call to <b>ReadBackupFile</b> is successful, this number is equal to the value that was specified in the <i>SizeToRead</i> parameter.</param>
    <param name="Flags">This parameter is reserved for future use.</param>
    <returns>This method can return standard <b>HRESULT</b> values, such as <b>S_OK</b>.
