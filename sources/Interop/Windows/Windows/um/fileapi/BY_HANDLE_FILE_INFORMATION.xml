  <member name="BY_HANDLE_FILE_INFORMATION.ftCreationTime">
    <summary>A <see cref="FILETIME" /> structure that specifies when a file or directory is created. If the underlying file system does not support creation time, this member is zero (0).</summary>

    <summary>A <see cref="FILETIME" /> structure. For a file, the structure specifies the last time that a file is read from or written to. For a directory, the structure specifies when the directory is created. For both files and directories, the specified date is correct, but the time of day is always set to midnight. If the underlying file system does not support the last access time, this member is zero (0).</summary>

  <member name="BY_HANDLE_FILE_INFORMATION.ftLastWriteTime">
    <summary>A <see cref="FILETIME" /> structure. For a file, the structure specifies the last time that a file is written to. For a directory, the structure specifies when the directory is created.

    <summary>
      <para>The low-order part of a unique identifier that is associated with a file.</para>
      <para>The identifier (low and high parts) and the volume serial number uniquely identify a file on a single computer. To determine whether two open handles represent the same file, combine the identifier and the volume serial number for each file and compare them.</para>
      <para>The ReFS file system, introduced with Windows Server 2012, includes 128-bit file identifiers. To retrieve the 128-bit file identifier use the<see cref="GetFileInformationByHandleEx" /> function with <b>FileIdInfo</b> to retrieve the<see cref="FILE_ID_INFO" /> structure. The 64-bit identifier in this structure is not guaranteed to be unique on ReFS.</para>
