    <summary>
      <para>Contains attribute information for a file or directory. The
<see cref="GetFileAttributesEx" /> function uses this
structure.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>Not all file systems can record creation and last access time, and not all file systems record them in the
same manner. For example, on the FAT file system, create time has a resolution of 10 milliseconds, write time has
a resolution of 2 seconds, and access time has a resolution of 1 day. On the NTFS file
system, access time has a resolution of 1 hour. For more information, see
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/SysInfo/file-times">File Times</a>.</para>
