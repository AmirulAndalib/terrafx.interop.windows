    <summary>
      <para>The <b>IUIManagerEventSink</b> interface is implemented by an app supporting IME UI integration to receive notifications of IME UI appearance. This enables the app to rearrange its UI layout to avoid having the app's UI elements overlapped by the IME UI.</para>
      <para>Call the TSF manager <see cref="ITfSource.AdviseSink" /> with <b>IID_IUIManagerEventSink</b> to install this sink.</para>
      <div>
        <b>Note</b>  This interface may not be supported for all IMEs. There may be differences in support between IME on the Desktop and IME in the new Windows UI on Windows 8.1.</div>
