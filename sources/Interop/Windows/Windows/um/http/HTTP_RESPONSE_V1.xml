    <summary>
      <para>The<b>HTTP_RESPONSE_V1</b> structure contains data associated with an HTTP response.</para>
      <para>Do not use <b>HTTP_RESPONSE_V1</b> directly in your code; use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/Http/http-response">HTTP_RESPONSE</a> instead to ensure that the proper version, based on the operating system the code is compiled under, is used.</para>

  <member name="HTTP_RESPONSE_V1.Flags">
    <summary>The optional logging flags change the default response behavior. These can be one of any of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/Http/http-response-flag--constants">HTTP_RESPONSE_FLAG</a> values.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="HTTP_RESPONSE_V1.Version">
    <summary>This member is ignored; the response is always an HTTP/1.1 response.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="HTTP_RESPONSE_V1.StatusCode">
    <summary>
      <para>Numeric status code that characterizes the result of the HTTP request (for example, 200 signifying "OK" or 404 signifying "Not Found"). For more information and a list of these codes, see Section 10 of<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">RFC 2616</a>.</para>
      <para>If a request is directed to a URL that is reserved but not registered, indicating that the appropriate application to handle it is not running, then the HTTP Server API itself returns a response with status code 400, signifying "Bad Request". This is transparent to the application. A code 400 is preferred here to 503 ("Server not available") because the latter is interpreted by some smart load balancers as an indication that the server is overloaded.</para>

  <member name="HTTP_RESPONSE_V1.ReasonLength">
    <summary>Size, in bytes, of the string pointed to by the <b>pReason</b> member not including the terminating null. May be zero.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="HTTP_RESPONSE_V1.pReason">
    <summary>A pointer to a human-readable, null-terminated string of printable characters that characterizes the result of the HTTP request (for example, "OK" or "Not Found").</summary>

  <member name="HTTP_RESPONSE_V1.EntityChunkCount">
    <summary>A number of entity-body data blocks specified in the <b>pEntityChunks</b> array. This number cannot exceed 100. If the response has no entity body, this member must be zero.</summary>

    <summary>An array of<see cref="HTTP_DATA_CHUNK" /> structures that together specify all the data blocks that make up the entity body of the response.</summary>
