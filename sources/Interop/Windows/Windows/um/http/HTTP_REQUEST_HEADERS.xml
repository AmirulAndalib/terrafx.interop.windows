  <member name="HTTP_REQUEST_HEADERS.KnownHeaders">
    <summary>Fixed-size array of<see cref="HTTP_KNOWN_HEADER" /> structures. The<see cref="HTTP_HEADER_ID" /> enumeration provides a mapping from header types to array indexes. If a known header of a given type is included in the HTTP request, the array element at the index that corresponds to that type specifies the header value. Those elements of the array for which no corresponding headers are present contain a zero-valued <b>RawValueLength</b> member. Use <b>RawValueLength</b> to determine the end of the header string pointed to by <b>pRawValue</b>, rather than relying on the string to have a terminating null.</summary>
