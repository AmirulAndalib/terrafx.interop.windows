    <summary>
      <para>Specifies that the interface is not ready to transmit or receive data. For example, the media is
disconnected or the port is not authenticated. In this state, it might be possible to transmit or
receive some information. For example, if the interface is down because it has not been authenticated,
802.1<i>x</i> authentication packets can be transmitted and received.</para>
