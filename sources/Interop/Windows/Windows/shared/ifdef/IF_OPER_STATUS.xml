    <summary>

    <summary>
      <para>The interface is not
in a condition to pass packets. The interface is  not up, but is
in a pending state, waiting for some external event.  This state identifies the situation where the
interface is waiting for events to place it in the up state.</para>

  <member name="IF_OPER_STATUS.IfOperStatusNotPresent">
    <summary>
      <para>This state is a refinement on the down state which
indicates that the interface is down specifically because
some component (for example, a hardware component) is not present in
the system.</para>

  <member name="IF_OPER_STATUS.IfOperStatusLowerLayerDown">
    <summary>
      <para>This state is a refinement on the down state.
The interface is operational, but a networking layer below the interface is not operational.</para>
