    <summary>
      <para>The NET_PHYSICAL_LOCATION structure provides NDIS with information about the physical location of a
registered network interface.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>A network interface provider initializes a
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/ns-ndis-_net_if_information">NET_IF_INFORMATION</a> structure to provide
NDIS with information about each registered interface. The NET_PHYSICAL_LOCATION structure is included in
the
<b>PhysicalLocation</b> member of the NET_IF_INFORMATION structure.</para>
      <para>NET_PHYSICAL_LOCATION contains information that remains constant during the lifetime of the interface.
To register an interface, a provider passes a pointer to a provider-initialized NET_IF_INFORMATION
structure to the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/nf-ndis-ndisifregisterinterface">NdisIfRegisterInterface</a> function.</para>
