    <summary>The number of transitions into the "Sender Limited" state from either the "Receiver Limited" or "Congestion Limited" states. This state is entered whenever TCP transmission stops due to some sender limit such as running out of application data or other resources and the Karn algorithm. When TCP stops sending data for any reason, which cannot be classified as "Receiver Limited" or "Congestion Limited", it is treated as "Sender Limited".</summary>
