    <summary>The <b>TCP_ESTATS_DATA_ROD_v0</b> structure contains read-only dynamic information for extended TCP statistics on data transfer for a TCP connection.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="TCP_ESTATS_DATA_ROD_v0.DataBytesOut">
    <summary>The number of octets of data contained in transmitted segments, including retransmitted data. Note that this does not include TCP headers.</summary>

  <member name="TCP_ESTATS_DATA_ROD_v0.DataSegsOut">
    <summary>The number of segments sent containing a positive length data segment.</summary>

    <summary>The number of octets contained in received data segments, including retransmitted data. Note that this does not include TCP headers.</summary>

    <summary>The number of segments received containing a positive length data segment.</summary>

  <member name="TCP_ESTATS_DATA_ROD_v0.SoftErrors">
    <summary>The number of segments that fail various consistency tests during TCP input processing. Soft errors might cause the segment to be discarded but some do not. Some of these soft errors cause the generation of a TCP acknowledgment, while others are silently discarded.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="TCP_ESTATS_DATA_ROD_v0.SoftErrorReason">
    <summary>A value that identifies which consistency test most recently failed during TCP input processing. This object is set every time the <b>SoftErrors</b> member is incremented.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="TCP_ESTATS_DATA_ROD_v0.SndUna">
    <summary>The value of the oldest unacknowledged sequence number. Note that this member is a TCP state variable.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="TCP_ESTATS_DATA_ROD_v0.SndNxt">
    <summary>The next sequence number to be sent. Note that this member is not monotonic (and thus not a counter), because TCP sometimes retransmits lost data by pulling the member back to the missing data.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="TCP_ESTATS_DATA_ROD_v0.SndMax">
    <summary>The farthest forward (right most or largest) sequence number to be sent. Note that this will be equal to the <b>SndNxt</b> member except when the <b>SndNxt</b> member is pulled back during recovery.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="TCP_ESTATS_DATA_ROD_v0.ThruBytesAcked">
    <summary>The number of octets for which cumulative acknowledgments have been received. Note that this will be the sum of changes to the <b>SndNxt</b> member.</summary>

  <member name="TCP_ESTATS_DATA_ROD_v0.RcvNxt">
    <summary>The next sequence number to be received. Note that this member is not monotonic (and thus not a counter), because TCP sometimes retransmits lost data by pulling the member back to the missing data.</summary>

    <summary>The number of octets for which cumulative acknowledgments have been sent. Note that this will be the sum of changes to the <b>RcvNxt</b> member.</summary>
