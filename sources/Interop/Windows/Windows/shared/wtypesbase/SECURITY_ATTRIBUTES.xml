  <member name="SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES">
    <summary>
      <para>The <b>SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES</b> structure contains the <see cref="security descriptor" /> for an object and specifies whether the handle retrieved by specifying this structure is inheritable. This structure provides security settings for objects created by various functions, such as <see cref="CreateFile" />, <see cref="CreatePipe" />, <see cref="CreateProcess" />, <see cref="RegCreateKeyEx" />, or <see cref="RegSaveKeyEx" />.</para>

  <member name="SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES.lpSecurityDescriptor">
    <summary>
      <para>A pointer to a <see cref="SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR" /> structure that controls access to the object. If the value of this member is <b>NULL</b>, the object is assigned the default security descriptor associated with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/win32/secauthz/access-tokens">access token</a> of the calling process. This is not the same as granting access to everyone by assigning a <b>NULL</b> <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/win32/secauthz/dacls-and-aces">discretionary access control list</a> (DACL). By default, the default DACL in the access token of a process allows access only to the user represented by the access token.</para>

    <summary>
      <para>A Boolean value that specifies whether the returned handle is inherited when a new process is created. If this member is <b>TRUE</b>, the new process inherits the handle.</para>
