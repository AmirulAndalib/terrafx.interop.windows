      <para>The CLSCTX_NO_FAILURE_LOG can be used to override the logging of failures in <see cref="CoCreateInstanceEx" />.</para>
      <para>If the ActivationFailureLoggingLevel is created, the following values can determine the status of event logging:</para>
      <list type="bullet">
        <item>
          <description>0 = Discretionary logging. Log by default, but clients can override by specifying CLSCTX_NO_FAILURE_LOG in <see cref="CoCreateInstanceEx" />.</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>1 = Always log all failures no matter what the client specified.</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>2 = Never log any failures no matter what client specified. If the registry entry is missing, the default is 0. If you need to control customer applications, it is recommended that you set this value to 0 and write the client code to override failures. It is strongly recommended that you do not set the value to 2. If event logging is disabled, it is more difficult to diagnose problems.</description>

  <member name="CLSCTX.CLSCTX_DISABLE_AAA">
    <summary>
      <para>Disables activate-as-activator (AAA) activations for this activation only. This flag overrides the setting of the EOAC_DISABLE_AAA flag from the EOLE_AUTHENTICATION_CAPABILITIES enumeration. This flag cannot be set at the same time as CLSCTX_ENABLE_AAA. Any activation where a server process would be launched under the caller's identity is known as an activate-as-activator (AAA) activation. Disabling AAA activations allows an application that runs under a privileged account (such as LocalSystem) to help prevent its identity from being used to launch untrusted components. Library applications that use activation calls should always set this flag during those calls. This helps prevent the library application from being used in an escalation-of-privilege security attack. This is the only way to disable AAA activations in a library application because the EOAC_DISABLE_AAA flag from the EOLE_AUTHENTICATION_CAPABILITIES enumeration is applied only to the server process and not to the library application.</para>
