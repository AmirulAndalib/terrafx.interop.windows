    <summary>
      <para>Identifies the DPI hosting behavior for a window. This behavior allows windows created in the thread to host child windows with a different <b>DPI_AWARENESS_CONTEXT</b></para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>
        <b>DPI_HOSTING_BEHAVIOR</b> enables a mixed content hosting behavior, which allows parent windows created in the thread to host child windows with a different <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/hidpi/dpi-awareness-context">DPI_AWARENESS_CONTEXT</a> value. This property only effects new windows created within this thread while the mixed hosting behavior is active. A parent window with this hosting behavior is able to host child windows with different <b>DPI_AWARENESS_CONTEXT</b> values, regardless of whether the child windows have mixed hosting behavior enabled.</para>
      <para>This hosting behavior does not allow for windows with per-monitor <b>DPI_AWARENESS_CONTEXT</b> values to be hosted by windows with <b>DPI_AWARENESS_CONTEXT</b> values of system or unaware.</para>
      <para>To avoid unexpected outcomes, a thread's <b>DPI_HOSTING_BEHAVIOR</b> should be changed to support mixed hosting behaviors only when creating a new window which needs to support those behaviors. Once that window is created, the hosting behavior should be switched back to its default value.</para>
      <para>Enabling mixed hosting behavior will not automatically adjust the thread's <b>DPI_AWARENESS_CONTEXT</b> to be compatible with legacy content. The thread's awareness context must still be manually changed before new windows are created to host such content.</para>

      <para>Invalid DPI hosting behavior. This usually occurs if the previous <see cref="SetThreadDpiHostingBehavior" /> call used an invalid parameter.</para>

    <summary>
      <para>Default DPI hosting behavior. The associated window behaves as normal, and cannot create or re-parent child windows with a different <b>DPI_AWARENESS_CONTEXT</b>.</para>

    <summary>
      <para>Mixed DPI hosting behavior. This enables the creation and re-parenting of child windows with different <b>DPI_AWARENESS_CONTEXT</b>. These child windows will be independently scaled by the OS.</para>
