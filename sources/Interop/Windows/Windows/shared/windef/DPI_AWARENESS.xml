  <member name="DPI_AWARENESS.DPI_AWARENESS_SYSTEM_AWARE">
    <summary>System DPI aware. This process does not scale for DPI changes. It will query for the DPI once and use that value for the lifetime of the process. If the DPI changes, the process will not adjust to the new DPI value. It will be automatically scaled up or down by the system when the DPI changes from the system value.</summary>

  <member name="DPI_AWARENESS.DPI_AWARENESS_PER_MONITOR_AWARE">
    <summary>Per monitor DPI aware. This process checks for the DPI when it is created and adjusts the scale factor whenever the DPI changes. These processes are not automatically scaled by the system.</summary>
