    <summary>
      <para>The
<b>MIBICMPSTATS</b> structure contains statistics for either incoming or outgoing Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) messages on a particular computer.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>Two
<b>MIBICMPSTATS</b> structures are required to hold all the ICMP statistics for a given computer. One
<b>MIBICMPSTATS</b> structure contains the statistics for incoming ICMP messages. The other contains the statistics for outgoing ICMP messages. For this reason, the
<see cref="MIBICMPINFO" /> structure contains two
<b>MIBICMPSTATS</b> structures.</para>
      <para>On the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) released for Windows Vista and later, the organization of header files has changed and the <b>MIBICMPSTATS</b> structure is defined in the <i>Ipmib.h</i> header file not in the <i>Iprtrmib.h</i> header file. Note that the <i>Ipmib.h</i> header file is automatically included in <i>Iprtrmib.h</i> which is automatically included in the <i>Iphlpapi.h</i> header file. The  <i>Ipmib.h</i> and <i>Iprtrmib.h</i> header files should never be used directly.</para>
