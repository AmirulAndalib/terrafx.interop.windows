    <summary>The<b>MIBICMPSTATS</b> structure contains statistics for either incoming or outgoing Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) messages on a particular computer.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="MIBICMPSTATS.dwMsgs">
    <summary>The number of messages received or sent.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="MIBICMPSTATS.dwErrors">
    <summary>The number of errors received or sent.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="MIBICMPSTATS.dwDestUnreachs">
    <summary>The number of destination-unreachable messages received or sent. A destination-unreachable message is sent to the originating computer when a datagram fails to reach its intended destination.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="MIBICMPSTATS.dwTimeExcds">
    <summary>The number of time-to-live (TTL) exceeded messages received or sent. A time-to-live exceeded message is sent to the originating computer when a datagram is discarded because the number of routers it has passed through exceeds its time-to-live value.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="MIBICMPSTATS.dwParmProbs">
    <summary>The number of parameter-problem messages received or sent. A parameter-problem message is sent to the originating computer when a router or host detects an error in a datagram's IP header.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="MIBICMPSTATS.dwSrcQuenchs">
    <summary>The number of source quench messages received or sent. A source quench request is sent to a computer to request that it reduce its rate of packet transmission.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="MIBICMPSTATS.dwRedirects">
    <summary>The number of redirect messages received or sent. A redirect message is sent to the originating computer when a better route is discovered for a datagram sent by that computer.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="MIBICMPSTATS.dwEchos">
    <summary>The number of echo requests received or sent. An echo request causes the receiving computer to send an echo reply message back to the originating computer.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="MIBICMPSTATS.dwEchoReps">
    <summary>The number of echo replies received or sent. A computer sends an echo reply in response to receiving an echo request message.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="MIBICMPSTATS.dwTimestamps">
    <summary>The number of time-stamp requests received or sent. A time-stamp request causes the receiving computer to send a time-stamp reply back to the originating computer.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="MIBICMPSTATS.dwTimestampReps">
    <summary>The number of time-stamp replies received or sent. A computer sends a time-stamp reply in response to receiving a time-stamp request. Routers can use time-stamp requests and replies to measure the transmission speed of datagrams on a network.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="MIBICMPSTATS.dwAddrMasks">
    <summary>The number of address mask requests received or sent. A computer sends an address mask request to determine the number of bits in the subnet mask for its local subnet.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="MIBICMPSTATS.dwAddrMaskReps">
    <summary>The number of address mask responses received or sent. A computer sends an address mask response in response to an address mask request.</summary>
