      <para>The

    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>On the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) released for Windows Server 2008and later, the organization of header files has changed. This  structure is defined in the <i>Ipmib.h</i> header file, not in the <i>Iprtrmib.h</i> header file. Note that the <i>Ipmib.h</i> header file is automatically included in <i>Iprtrmib.h</i>, which is automatically included in the <i>Iphlpapi.h</i> header file. The  <i>Ipmib.h</i> and <i>Iprtrmib.h</i> header files should never be used directly.</para>

      <para>Specifies the address of the next hop that corresponds to <b>dwOutIfIndex</b>. The <b>dwOutIfIndex</b> and <b>dwIfNextHopIPAddr</b> members uniquely identify a next hop on point-to-multipoint interfaces, where one interface connects to multiple networks. Examples of point-to-multipoint interfaces include non-broadcast multiple-access (NBMA) interfaces, and the internal interface on which all dial-up clients connect.</para>
