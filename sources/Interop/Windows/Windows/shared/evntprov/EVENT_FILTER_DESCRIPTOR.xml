              <b>EVENT_FILTER_TYPE_SCHEMATIZED</b> (0x80000000)</para>
            <para>A schematized filter.</para>
            <para>This is the traditional filtering setup also called provider-side filtering. The controller defines a custom set of filters as a binary object that is passed to the provider in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/ETW/enabletrace">EnableTrace</a>,<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/ETW/enabletraceex-func">EnableTraceEx</a>, or<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/ETW/enabletraceex2">EnableTraceEx2</a> call. It is incumbent on the controller and provider to define and interpret these filters and the controller should only log applicable events. This requires a close coupling of the controller and provider since the type and format of the binary object of what can be filtered is not defined. The<see cref="TdhEnumerateProviderFilters" />function can be used to retrieve the filters defined in a manifest.</para>
            <para>For more information on schematized filters, see<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/WES/defining-filters">Defining Filters</a>.</para>

            <para>The process ID. This is one of the scope filters.</para>
            <para>Filtering ETW events based on process IDs will result in an event stream (file or real-time) that contains the events from the providers in the specified processes only. It will only enable the provider in the processes whose PIDs are provided. The list of PIDs is the PIDs of the processes running at the time when <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/ETW/enabletraceex2">EnableTraceEx2</a> is called and will enable the provider in all the processes (for which PIDs are provided) at that particular time. The list of PIDs will not be stored in the session. So when a process is terminated and then reappears, the provider in it will not get automatically enabled to the trace session. The PIDs based filter-blob is only valid for a kernel mode logger session because the private logger session runs inside a user-mode process.</para>
            <para>The maximum number of process IDs that can be filtered is limited by<b>MAX_EVENT_FILTER_PID_COUNT</b> defined in the <i>evntprov.h</i> header file to 8.</para>
            <para>In case a process ID filter is provided, then the provider will be enabled in the user-mode processes only. In case, the same provider is registered by a kernel-mode driver, it will not be enabled.</para>
