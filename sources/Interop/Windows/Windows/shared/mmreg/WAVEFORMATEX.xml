  <member name="WAVEFORMATEX">
    <summary>The WAVEFORMATEX structure specifies the data format of a wave audio stream.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="WAVEFORMATEX.wFormatTag">
    <summary>Specifies the waveform audio format type. For more information, see the following Remarks section.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="WAVEFORMATEX.nChannels">
    <summary>Specifies the number of channels of audio data. For monophonic audio, set this member to 1. For stereo, set this member to 2.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="WAVEFORMATEX.nSamplesPerSec">
    <summary>Specifies the sample frequency at which each channel should be played or recorded. If <b>wFormatTag</b> = WAVE_FORMAT_PCM, then common values for <b>nSamplesPerSec</b> are 8.0 kHz, 11.025 kHz, 22.05 kHz, and 44.1 kHz. For example, to specify a sample frequency of 11.025 kHz, set <b>nSamplesPerSec</b> to 11025. For non-PCM formats, this member should be computed according to the manufacturer's specification of the format tag.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="WAVEFORMATEX.nAvgBytesPerSec">
    <summary>Specifies the required average data transfer rate in bytes per second. This value is useful for estimating buffer size.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="WAVEFORMATEX.nBlockAlign">
    <summary>
      <para>Specifies the block alignment in bytes. The block alignment is the size of the minimum atomic unit of data for the <b>wFormatTag</b> format type. If <b>wFormatTag</b> = WAVE_FORMAT_PCM or <b>wFormatTag</b> = WAVE_FORMAT_IEEE_FLOAT, set <b>nBlockAlign</b> to <code>(nChannels*wBitsPerSample)/8</code>, which is the size of a single audio frame. For non-PCM formats, this member should be computed according to the manufacturer's specification for the format tag.</para>
      <para>Playback and record software should process a multiple of <b>nBlockAlign</b> bytes of data at a time. Data written to and read from a device should always start at the beginning of a block.</para>
    </summary>
  </member>
  <member name="WAVEFORMATEX.wBitsPerSample">
    <summary>Specifies the number of bits per sample for the format type specified by <b>wFormatTag</b>. If <b>wFormatTag</b> = WAVE_FORMAT_PCM, then <b>wBitsPerSample</b> should be set to either 8 or 16. If <b>wFormatTag</b> = WAVE_FORMAT_IEEE_FLOAT, <b>wBitsPerSample</b> should be set to 32. For non-PCM formats, set the value of this member according to the manufacturer's specification for the format tag. Some compression schemes cannot define a value for <b>wBitsPerSample</b>. In this case, set <b>wBitsPerSample</b> to zero.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="WAVEFORMATEX.cbSize">
    <summary>Specifies the size, in bytes, of extra format information appended to the end of the WAVEFORMATEX structure. This information can be used by non-PCM formats to store extra attributes for the <b>wFormatTag</b>. If no extra information is required by the <b>wFormatTag</b>, set this member to zero. For WAVE_FORMAT_PCM formats, clients should ignore this member (its value is implicitly zero). Because all clients might not follow this rule, we recommend that you initialize <b>cbSize</b> to zero for WAVE_FORMAT_PCM formats.</summary>
