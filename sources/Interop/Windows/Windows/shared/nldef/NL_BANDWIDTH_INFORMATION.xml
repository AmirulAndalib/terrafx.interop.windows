    <summary>
      <para>The <b>NL_BANDWIDTH_INFORMATION</b> structure contains read-only information on the available bandwidth estimates and associated variance as determined by the TCP/IP stack.</para>

    <remarks>
      <para>The  <b>NL_BANDWIDTH_INFORMATION</b> structure is defined in the <i>Nldef.h</i> header file which is automatically included by the <i>Iptypes.h</i> header file which is automatically included in the <i>Iphlpapi.h</i> header file. The  <i>Nldef.h</i> and <i>Iptypes.h</i> header files should never be used directly.</para>

  <member name="NL_BANDWIDTH_INFORMATION.BandwidthPeaked">
    <summary>
      <para>A value that indicates if the bandwidth estimate in the <b>Bandwidth</b> member has peaked and reached its maximum value for the given network conditions.</para>
      <para>The TCP/IP stack uses a heuristic to set this variable. Until this variable is set, there is no guarantee that the true available maximum bandwidth is not higher than the estimated bandwidth in the <b>Bandwidth</b> member. However, it is safe to assume that maximum available bandwidth is not lower than the estimate reported in the <b>Bandwidth</b> member.</para>
