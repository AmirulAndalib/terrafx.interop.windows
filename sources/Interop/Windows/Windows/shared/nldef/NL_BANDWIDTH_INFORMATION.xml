    <summary>
      <para>A value that indicates if the bandwidth estimate in the <b>Bandwidth</b> member has peaked and reached its maximum value for the given network conditions.</para>
      <para>The TCP/IP stack uses a heuristic to set this variable. Until this variable is set, there is no guarantee that the true available maximum bandwidth is not higher than the estimated bandwidth in the <b>Bandwidth</b> member. However, it is safe to assume that maximum available bandwidth is not lower than the estimate reported in the <b>Bandwidth</b> member.</para>
