  <member name="PaletteType.PaletteTypeFixedHalftone8">
    <summary>A palette based on two intensities each (off or full) for the red, green, and blue channels. Also contains the 16 colors of the system palette. Because all eight of the on/off combinations of red, green, and blue are already in the system palette, this palette is the same as the system palette. This palette type is suitable for bitmaps that store 4 bits per pixel.</summary>

  <member name="PaletteType.PaletteTypeFixedHalftone27">
    <summary>A palette based on three intensities each for the red, green, and blue channels. Also contains the 16 colors of the system palette. Eight of the 16 system palette colors are among the 27 three-intensity combinations of red, green, and blue, so the total number of colors in the palette is 35. If the palette also includes the transparent color, the total number of colors is 36.</summary>

  <member name="PaletteType.PaletteTypeFixedHalftone64">
    <summary>A palette based on four intensities each for the red, green, and blue channels. Also contains the 16 colors of the system palette.
