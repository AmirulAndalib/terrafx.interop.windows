    <summary>Identifies resize behavior when the back-buffer size does not match the size of the target output.</summary>

    <summary>Directs DXGI to make the back-buffer contents scale to fit the presentation target size. This is the implicit behavior of DXGI when you call the <see cref="IDXGIFactory.CreateSwapChain" /> method.</summary>

    <summary>
      <para>Directs DXGI to make the back-buffer contents appear without any scaling when the presentation target size is not equal to the back-buffer size. The top edges of the back buffer and presentation target are aligned together. If the WS_EX_LAYOUTRTL style is associated with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">HWND</a> handle to the target output window, the right edges of the back buffer and presentation target are aligned together; otherwise, the left edges are aligned together. All target area outside the back buffer is filled with window background color.</para>
      <para>This value specifies that all target areas outside the back buffer of a swap chain are filled with the background color that you specify in a call to <see cref="IDXGISwapChain1.SetBackgroundColor" />.</para>

    <summary>
      <para>Directs DXGI to make the back-buffer contents scale to fit the presentation target size, while preserving the aspect ratio of the back-buffer. If the scaled back-buffer does not fill the presentation area, it will be centered with black borders.</para>
      <para>This constant is supported on Windows Phone 8 and Windows 10.</para>
      <para>Note that with legacy Win32 window swapchains, this works the same as DXGI_SCALING_STRETCH.</para>
