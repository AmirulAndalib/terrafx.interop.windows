          <description>The data at pData is a pointer to an <see cref="IUnknown" /> interface. SizeOfData must be set to the size of a pointer to IUnknown, that is, sizeof(IUnknown*). Direct3D automatically callsIUnknown through pData when the private data is destroyed. Private data will be destroyed by a subsequent call to <b>IDirect3DResource9.SetPrivateData</b> with the same GUID, a subsequent call to <see cref="IDirect3DResource9.FreePrivateData" />, or when the <see cref="IDirect3D9" /> object is released.
