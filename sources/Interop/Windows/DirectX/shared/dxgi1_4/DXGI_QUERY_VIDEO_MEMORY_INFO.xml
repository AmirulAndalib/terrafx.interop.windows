  <member name="DXGI_QUERY_VIDEO_MEMORY_INFO.Budget">
    <summary>
      <para>Specifies the OS-provided video memory budget, in bytes, that the application should target. If <i>CurrentUsage</i> is greater than <i>Budget</i>, the application may incur stuttering or performance penalties due to background activity by the OS to provide other applications with a fair usage of video memory.</para>

  <member name="DXGI_QUERY_VIDEO_MEMORY_INFO.AvailableForReservation">
    <summary>
      <para>The amount of video memory, in bytes, that the application has available for reservation. To reserve this video memory, the application should call <see cref="IDXGIAdapter3.SetVideoMemoryReservation" />.</para>

  <member name="DXGI_QUERY_VIDEO_MEMORY_INFO.CurrentReservation">
    <summary>
      <para>The amount of video memory, in bytes, that is reserved by the application. The OS uses the reservation as a hint to determine the application’s minimum working set. Applications should attempt to ensure that their video memory usage can be trimmed to meet this requirement.</para>
