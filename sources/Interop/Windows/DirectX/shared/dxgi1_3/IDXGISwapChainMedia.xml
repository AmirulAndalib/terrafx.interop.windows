  <member name="IDXGISwapChainMedia.CheckPresentDurationSupport">
    <summary>Queries the graphics driver for a supported frame present duration corresponding to a custom refresh rate.</summary>
    <param name="DesiredPresentDuration">Indicates the frame duration to check. This value is the duration of one frame at the desired refresh rate, specified in hundreds of nanoseconds. For example, set this field to 167777 to check for 60 Hz refresh rate support.</param>
    <param name="pClosestSmallerPresentDuration">A variable that will be set to the closest supported frame present duration that's smaller than the requested value, or zero if the device does not support any lower duration.</param>
    <param name="pClosestLargerPresentDuration">A variable that will be set to the closest supported frame present duration that's larger than the requested value, or zero if the device does not support any higher duration.</param>
    <returns>This method returns S_OK on success, or a DXGI error code on failure.</returns>

    <summary>
      <para>This swap chain interface allows desktop media applications to request a seamless change to a specific refresh rate.</para>
      <para>For example, a media application presenting video at a typical framerate of 23.997 frames per second can request a custom refresh rate of 24 or 48 Hz to eliminate jitter. If the request is approved, the app starts presenting frames at the custom refresh rate immediately - without the typical 'mode switch' a user would experience when changing the refresh rate themselves by using the control panel.</para>
