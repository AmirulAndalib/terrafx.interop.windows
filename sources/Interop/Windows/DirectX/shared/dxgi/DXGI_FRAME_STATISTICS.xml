  <member name="DXGI_FRAME_STATISTICS">
    <summary>
      <para>Describes timing and presentation statistics for a frame.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>You initialize the <b>DXGI_FRAME_STATISTICS</b> structure with the <see cref="IDXGIOutput.GetFrameStatistics" /> or <see cref="IDXGISwapChain.GetFrameStatistics" /> method.</para>
      <para>You can only use <see cref="IDXGISwapChain.GetFrameStatistics" /> for swap chains that either use the flip presentation model or draw in full-screen mode. You set the <see cref="DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_FLIP_SEQUENTIAL" /> value in the <b>SwapEffect</b> member of the <see cref="DXGI_SWAP_CHAIN_DESC1" /> structure to specify that the swap chain uses the flip presentation model.</para>
      <para>The values in the <b>PresentCount</b> and <b>PresentRefreshCount</b> members indicate information about when a frame was presented on the display screen. You can use these values to determine whether a glitch occurred. The values in the <b>SyncRefreshCount</b> and <b>SyncQPCTime</b> members indicate timing information that you can use for audio and video synchronization or very precise animation. If the swap chain draws in full-screen mode, these values are based on when the computer booted.
If the swap chain draws in windowed mode, these values are based on when the swap chain is created.</para>

      <para>A value that represents the running total count of times that an image was presented to the monitor since the computer booted.</para>

        <b>Note</b>  The number of times that an image was presented to the monitor is not necessarily the same as the number of times
