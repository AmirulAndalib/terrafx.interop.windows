  <member name="IDXGISurface1.GetDC">
    <summary>Returns a device context (DC) that allows you to render to a Microsoft DirectX Graphics Infrastructure (DXGI) surface using Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI).</summary>
    <param name="Discard">A Boolean value that specifies whether to preserve Direct3D contents in the GDI DC. <b>TRUE</b> directs the runtime not to preserve Direct3D contents in the GDI DC; that is, the runtime discards the Direct3D contents. <b>FALSE</b> guarantees that Direct3D contents are available in the GDI DC.</param>
    <param name="phdc">A pointer to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">HDC</a> handle that represents the current device context for GDI rendering.</param>
    <returns>Returns S_OK if successful; otherwise, an error code.</returns>

  <member name="IDXGISurface1.ReleaseDC">
    <summary>Releases the GDI device context (DC) that is associated with the current surface and allows you to use Direct3D to render.</summary>
    <param name="pDirtyRect">
      <para>A pointer to a <b>RECT</b> structure that identifies the dirty region of the surface.<br />A dirty region is any part of the surface that you used for GDI rendering and that you want to preserve. This area is used as a performance hint to graphics subsystem in certain scenarios. Do not use this parameter to restrict rendering to the specified rectangular region. If you pass in <b>NULL</b>, <b>ReleaseDC</b> considers the whole surface as dirty. Otherwise, <b>ReleaseDC</b> uses the area specified by the RECT as a performance hint to indicate what areas have been manipulated by GDI rendering.</para>
      <para>You can pass a pointer to an empty <b>RECT</b> structure (a rectangle with no position or area) if you didn't change any content.</para>
    </param>
    <returns>If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.</returns>
