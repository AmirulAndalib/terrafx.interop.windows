  <member name="IDXGIKeyedMutex.AcquireSync">
    <summary>Using a key, acquires exclusive rendering access to a shared resource.</summary>
    <param name="Key">A value that indicates which device to give access to. This method will succeed when the device that currently owns the surface calls the <see cref="IDXGIKeyedMutex.ReleaseSync" /> method using the same value. This value can be any UINT64 value.</param>
    <param name="dwMilliseconds">The time-out interval, in milliseconds. This method will return if the interval elapses, and the keyed mutex has not been released using the specified <i>Key</i>. If this value is set to zero, the <b>AcquireSync</b> method will test to see if the keyed mutex has been released and returns immediately. If this value is set to INFINITE, the time-out interval will never elapse.</param>
    <returns>
      <para>Return S_OK if successful.</para>
      <para>If the owning device attempted to create another keyed mutex on the same shared resource, <b>AcquireSync</b> returns E_FAIL.</para>
      <para>
        <b>AcquireSync</b> can also return the following <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">DWORD</a> constants. Therefore, you should explicitly check for these constants. If you only use the <see cref="SUCCEEDED" /> macro on the return value to determine if <b>AcquireSync</b> succeeded, you will not catch these constants.</para>
      <list type="bullet">
        <item>
          <description>WAIT_ABANDONED - The shared surface and keyed mutex are no longer in a consistent state. If <b>AcquireSync</b> returns this value, you should release and recreate both the keyed mutex and the shared surface.</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>WAIT_TIMEOUT - The time-out interval elapsed before the specified key was released.</description>
