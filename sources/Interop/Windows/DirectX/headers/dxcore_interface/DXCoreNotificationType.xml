      <para>You can register and unregister for these notifications by calling <see cref="IDXCoreAdapterFactory.RegisterEventNotification" /> and <see cref="IDXCoreAdapterFactory.UnregisterEventNotification" />, respectively.</para>

  <member name="DXCoreNotificationType.AdapterListStale">
    <summary>
      <para>This notification is raised by an <see cref="IDXCoreAdapterList" /> object when the adapter list becomes stale. The fresh-to-stale transition is one-way, and one-time, so this notification is raised at most one time.</para>
    </summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DXCoreNotificationType.AdapterNoLongerValid">
    <summary>
      <para>This notification is raised by an <see cref="IDXCoreAdapter" /> object when the adapter becomes no longer valid. The valid-to-invalid transition is one-way, and one-time, so this notification is raised at most one time.</para>
    </summary>

  <member name="DXCoreNotificationType.AdapterBudgetChange">
    <summary>
      <para>This notification is raised by an <see cref="IDXCoreAdapter" /> object when an adapter budget change occurs. This notification can occur many times. Using this notification is functionally similar to <see cref="IDXGIAdapter3.RegisterVideoMemoryBudgetChangeNotificationEvent" />. In response to this event, you should call <see cref="IDXCoreAdapter.QueryState" /> (with <see cref="DXCoreAdapterState.AdapterMemoryBudget" />) to evaluate the current memory budget state.</para>

  <member name="DXCoreNotificationType.AdapterHardwareContentProtectionTeardown">
    <summary>
      <para>This notification is raised by an <see cref="IDXCoreAdapter" /> object to notify of an adapter's hardware content protection teardown. This notification can occur many times. It is functionally similar to <see cref="IDXGIAdapter3.RegisterHardwareContentProtectionTeardownStatusEvent" />. In response to this event, you should re-evaluate the current crypto session status; for example, by calling <see cref="ID3D11VideoContext1.CheckCryptoSessionStatus" /> to determine the impact of the hardware teardown for a specific <see cref="ID3D11CryptoSession" /> interface.</para>
