    <summary>Specifies the type of shader patching used by GPU-Based Validation at either the device or command list level.</summary>

    <summary>No shader patching is to be done. This will retain the original shader bytecode. Can lead to errors in some of the GPU-Based Validation state tracking as the unpatched shader may still change resource state (see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/direct3d12/using-resource-barriers-to-synchronize-resource-states-in-direct3d-12">Common state promotion</a>) but the promotion will be untracked without patching the shader. This can improve performance but no validation will be performed and may also lead to misleading GPU-Based Validation errors. Use this mode very carefully.</summary>
