    <summary>
      <para>Identifies the tier level at which tiled resources are supported.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>This enum is used by the <see cref="D3D12_FEATURE_DATA_D3D12_OPTIONS" /> structure.</para>
      <para>There are three discrete pieces of functionality bundled together for tiled resource functionality:</para>
      <list type="bullet">
        <item>
          <description>A tile-based texture layout option where nearby texel addresses contain nearby data coordinates.
A tile of texels contains nearly the same amount of texels in each cardinal dimension of the resource.
This layout is represented in D3D12 by <see cref="D3D12_TEXTURE_LAYOUT_64KB_UNDEFINED_SWIZZLE" />.
</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>Reserve a region of virtual address space for a resource, where each page is initially NULL-mapped.
In D3D12, this is operation is encapsulated within <see cref="ID3D12Device.CreateReservedResource" />,
which only works with textures that have the D3D12_TEXTURE_LAYOUT_64KB_UNDEFINED_SWIZZLE layout.
</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>The ability to change page mappings and manipulate texture data on tile granularities.
In D3D12, these operations are
<see cref="ID3D12CommandQueue.UpdateTileMappings" />,
<see cref="ID3D12CommandQueue.CopyTileMappings" />, and
<see cref="ID3D12GraphicsCommandList.CopyTiles" />.
</description>
        </item>
      </list>
      <para>Three significant changes over D3D11 are:</para>
      <list type="bullet">
        <item>
          <description>Tile pools are replaced by heaps.
Heaps provide a superset of capabilities than D3D11 tile pools do.
</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>Reserved resources may be mapped to pages from multiple heaps at the same time.
The D3D11 restriction that all non-NULL mapped pages must come from the same heap does not exist.
</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>Applications should be aware of GPU virtual address capabilities, which enable litmus tests for particular usage scenarios.
See <see cref="D3D12_FEATURE_GPU_VIRTUAL_ADDRESS_SUPPORT" />.

      <para>Indicates that 2D textures can be created with the D3D12_TEXTURE_LAYOUT_64KB_UNDEFINED_SWIZZLE layout.
Limitations exist for certain resource formats and properties.

        <see cref="ID3D12Device.CreateReservedResource" /> can be used.</para>
      <para>GPU reads or writes to NULL mappings are undefined.
Applications are encouraged to workaround this limitation by repeatedly mapping the same page to everywhere a NULL mapping would've been used.</para>

          <description>Shader instructions are available for clamping level-of-detail (LOD) and for obtaining status about the shader operation.
For info about one of these shader instructions, see Sample(S,float,int,float,uint).
