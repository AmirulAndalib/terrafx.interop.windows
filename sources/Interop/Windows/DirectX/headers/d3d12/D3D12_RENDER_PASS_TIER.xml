    <summary>The user-mode display driver hasn't implemented render passes, and so the feature is provided only via software emulation. Render passes might not provide a performance advantage at this level of support.</summary>

    <summary>The render passes feature is implemented by the user-mode display driver, and render target/depth buffer writes may be accelerated. Unordered access view (UAV) writes are not efficiently supported within the render pass.</summary>

    <summary>The render passes feature is implemented by the user-mode display driver, render target/depth buffer writes may be accelerated, and unordered access view (UAV) writes (provided that writes in a render pass are not read until a subsequent render pass) are likely to be more efficient than issuing the same work without using a render pass.</summary>
