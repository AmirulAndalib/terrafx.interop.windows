    <summary>Like <b>D3D12_MEASUREMENTS_ACTION_COMMIT_RESULTS</b>, but also specifies that your application doesn't care about glitches, so the runtime should ignore the usual idle priority rules and go ahead using as many threads as possible to get shader recompiles done fast. Available only in <b>Developer mode</b>.</summary>
