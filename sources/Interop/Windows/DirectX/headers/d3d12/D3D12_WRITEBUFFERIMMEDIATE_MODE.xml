  <member name="D3D12_WRITEBUFFERIMMEDIATE_MODE.D3D12_WRITEBUFFERIMMEDIATE_MODE_MARKER_OUT">
    <summary>The write operation is deferred until all previous commands in the command stream have completed through the GPU pipeline, including previous <b>WriteBufferImmediate</b> operations. Write operations that specify <b>D3D12_WRITEBUFFERIMMEDIATE_MODE_MARKER_OUT</b> don't block subsequent operations from starting. If there are no previous operations in the command stream, then the write operation behaves as if <b>D3D12_WRITEBUFFERIMMEDIATE_MODE_MARKER_IN</b> was specified.</summary>
