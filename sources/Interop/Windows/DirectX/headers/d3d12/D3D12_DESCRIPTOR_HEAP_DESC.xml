    <summary>For single-adapter operation, set this to zero. If there are multiple adapter nodes, set a bit to identify the node (one of the device's physical adapters) to which the descriptor heap applies. Each bit in the mask corresponds to a single node. Only one bit must be set. See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/win32/direct3d12/multi-engine">Multi-adapter systems</a>.</summary>
