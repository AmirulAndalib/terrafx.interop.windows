    <summary>Specifies which resource heap tier the hardware and driver support.</summary>

  <member name="D3D12_RESOURCE_HEAP_TIER.D3D12_RESOURCE_HEAP_TIER_1">
    <summary>Indicates that heaps can only support resources from a single resource category. For the list of resource categories, see Remarks. In tier 1, these resource categories are mutually exclusive and cannot be used with the same heap. The resource category must be declared when creating a heap, using the correct <see cref="D3D12_HEAP_FLAGS" /> enumeration constant. Applications cannot create heaps with flags that allow all three categories.</summary>

  <member name="D3D12_RESOURCE_HEAP_TIER.D3D12_RESOURCE_HEAP_TIER_2">
    <summary>Indicates that heaps can support resources from all three categories. For the list of resource categories, see Remarks. In tier 2, these resource categories can be mixed within the same heap. Applications may create heaps with flags that allow all three categories; but are not required to do so. Applications may be written to support tier 1 and seamlessly run on tier 2.</summary>
