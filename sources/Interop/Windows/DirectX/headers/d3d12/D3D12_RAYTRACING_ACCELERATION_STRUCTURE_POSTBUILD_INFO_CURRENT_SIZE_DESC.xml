    <summary>
      <para>Space currently used by an acceleration structure.  If the acceleration structure hasn’t had a compaction operation performed on it, this size is the same one reported by <see cref="GetRaytracingAccelerationStructurePrebuildInfo" />, and if it has been compacted this size is the same reported for post-build info with <see cref="D3D12_RAYTRACING_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_POSTBUILD_INFO_COMPACTED_SIZE" />.</para>
