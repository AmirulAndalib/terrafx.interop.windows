    <summary>
      <para>A state subobject that identifies the GPU nodes to which the state object applies.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>This subobject is optional. In its absence, the state object applies to all available nodes.  If a node mask subobject has been associated with any part of a state object, a node mask association must be made to all exports in a state object (including imported collections) and all node mask subobjects that are referenced must have matching content.</para>
      <blockquote>
        <para>[!IMPORTANT]
On some versions of the DirectX Runtime, specifying a node via <b>D3D12_NODE_MASK</b> in a <see cref="D3D12_STATE_SUBOBJECT" /> with type <see cref="D3D12_STATE_SUBOBJECT_TYPE_NODE_MASK" />, the runtime will incorrectly handle a node mask value of <code>0</code>, which should use node #1, which will lead to errors when attempting to use the state object later. Specify an explicit node value of 1, or omit the <b>D3D12_NODE_MASK</b> subobject to avoid this issue.</para>
