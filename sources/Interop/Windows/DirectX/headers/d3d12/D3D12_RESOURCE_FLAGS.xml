      <para>Allows a render target view to be created for the resource; and also enables the resource to transition into the state of <see cref="D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_RENDER_TARGET" />. Some adapter architectures allocate extra memory for textures with this flag to reduce the effective bandwidth during common rendering. This characteristic may not be beneficial for textures that are never rendered to, nor is it available for textures compressed with BC formats.
