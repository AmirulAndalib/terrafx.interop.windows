  <member name="ID3D12PipelineLibrary.GetSerializedSize">
    <summary>Returns the amount of memory required to serialize the current contents of the database.</summary>
    <returns>This method returns a SIZE_T object, containing the size required in bytes.</returns>
  </member>
  <member name="ID3D12PipelineLibrary.LoadComputePipeline">
    <summary>Retrieves the requested PSO from the library. The input desc is matched against the data in the current library database, and remembered in order to prevent duplication of PSO contents.</summary>
    <param name="pName">The unique name of the PSO.</param>
    <param name="pDesc">Specifies a description of the required PSO in a <see cref="D3D12_COMPUTE_PIPELINE_STATE_DESC" /> structure. This input description is matched against the data in the current library database, and stored in order to prevent duplication of PSO contents.</param>
    <param name="riid">Specifies a REFIID for the <see cref="ID3D12PipelineState" /> object. Typically set this, and the following parameter, with the macro <code>IID_PPV_ARGS(&amp;PSO1)</code>, where <i>PSO1</i> is the name of the object.</param>
    <param name="ppPipelineState">Specifies a pointer that will reference the returned PSO.</param>
    <returns>This method returns an HRESULT success or error code, which can include E_INVALIDARG if the name doesn’t exist, or if the input description doesn’t match the data in the library, and E_OUTOFMEMORY if unable to allocate the return PSO.</returns>

  <member name="ID3D12PipelineLibrary.Serialize">
    <summary>Writes the contents of the library to the provided memory, to be provided back to the runtime at a later time.</summary>
    <param name="pData">Specifies a pointer to the data. This memory must be readable and writable up to the input size. This data can be saved and provided to <see cref="CreatePipelineLibrary" /> at a later time, including future instances of this or other processes. The data becomes invalidated if the runtime or driver is updated, and is not portable to other hardware or devices.</param>
    <param name="DataSizeInBytes">The size provided must be at least the size returned from <see cref="GetSerializedSize" />.</param>
    <returns>This method returns an HRESULT success or error code, including E_INVALIDARG if the buffer provided isn’t big enough.</returns>

    <summary>Adds the input PSO to an internal database with the corresponding name.</summary>
    <param name="pName">Specifies a unique name for the library. Overwriting is not supported.</param>
    <param name="pPipeline">Specifies the <see cref="ID3D12PipelineState" /> to add.</param>
    <returns>This method returns an HRESULT success or error code, including E_INVALIDARG if the name already exists, E_OUTOFMEMORY if unable to allocate storage in the library.</returns>
