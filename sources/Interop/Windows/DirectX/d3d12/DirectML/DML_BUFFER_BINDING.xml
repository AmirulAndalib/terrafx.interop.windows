  <member name="DML_BUFFER_BINDING.Buffer">
    <summary>An optional pointer to an <see cref="ID3D12Resource" /> interface representing a buffer. The resource must have dimension <see cref="D3D12_RESOURCE_DIMENSION_BUFFER" />, and the range described by this struct must lie within the bounds of the buffer. You may supply <b>nullptr</b> for this member to indicate 'no binding'.</summary>

    <summary>The offset, in bytes, from the start of the buffer where the range begins. This offset must be aligned to a multiple of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/direct3d12/direct3d-directml-constants">DML_MINIMUM_BUFFER_TENSOR_ALIGNMENT</a> or the <b>GuaranteedBaseOffsetAlignment</b> supplied as part of the<see cref="DML_BUFFER_TENSOR_DESC" />.</summary>
