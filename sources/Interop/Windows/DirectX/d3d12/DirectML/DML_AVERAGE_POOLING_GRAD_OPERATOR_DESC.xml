    <summary>
      <para>Computes backpropagation gradients for average pooling (see <see cref="DML_AVERAGE_POOLING_OPERATOR_DESC" />).</para>
      <para>Consider a 2x2 <b>DML_AVERAGE_POOLING_OPERATOR_DESC</b>, without padding and a stride of 1, that performs the following.</para>
      <code>InputTensor OutputTensor [[[[1, 2, 3], AvgPool [[[[3, 4], [4, 5, 6], --&gt; [6, 7]]]] [7, 8, 9]]]]</code>
      <para>Each 2x2 window in the input tensor is averaged to produce one element of the output (reading zeros for elements beyond the edge). Here's an example of the output of <b>DML_AVERAGE_POOLING_GRAD_OPERATOR_DESC</b> given similar parameters.</para>
      <code>InputGradientTensor OutputGradientTensor [[[[1, 2], AvgPoolGrad [[[[0.25, 0.75, 0.5], [3, 4]]]] --&gt; [ 1, 2.5, 1.5], [0.75, 1.75, 1]]]]</code>
      <para>Notice that the values in the <i>OutputGradientTensor</i> represent the weighted contributions of that element to the <i>OutputTensor</i> during the original <see cref="DML_AVERAGE_POOLING_OPERATOR_DESC" /> operator.</para>

    <summary>The incoming gradient tensor. This is typically obtained from the output of backpropagation of a preceding layer. Typically this tensor would have the same sizes as the <i>output</i> of the corresponding <see cref="DML_AVERAGE_POOLING_OPERATOR_DESC" /> in the forward pass.</summary>

    <summary>An output tensor containing the backpropagated gradients. Typically this tensor would have the same sizes as the <i>input</i> of the corresponding <see cref="DML_AVERAGE_POOLING_OPERATOR_DESC" /> in the forward pass.</summary>
