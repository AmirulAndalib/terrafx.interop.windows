    <summary>
      <para>Computes the bitwise population count (the number of bits set to 1) for each element of the input tensor, and writes the result into the output tensor.</para>
      <para>The bitwise operation is applied to tensor data in its native encoding. Therefore, the tensor data type is ignored except for determining the width of each element.</para>
