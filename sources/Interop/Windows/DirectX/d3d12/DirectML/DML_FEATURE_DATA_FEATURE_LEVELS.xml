    <summary>Provides detail about the feature levels supported by a DirectML device. See <see cref="IDMLDevice.CheckFeatureSupport" />. The feature constant is <b>DML_FEATURE_FEATURE_LEVELS</b>, and the query data type is <see cref="DML_FEATURE_QUERY_FEATURE_LEVELS" />.</summary>

  <member name="DML_FEATURE_DATA_FEATURE_LEVELS.MaxSupportedFeatureLevel">
    <summary>
      <para>The highest feature level supplied in the query structure's <i>RequestedFeatureLevels</i> (see <see cref="DML_FEATURE_DATA_FEATURE_LEVELS" />) that is supported by this device.</para>
      <blockquote>[!NOTE] Because this feature query only ever returns one of the values supplied in <i>RequestedFeatureLevels</i>, it's possible that the device supports an even higher feature level than the one returned by this query.</blockquote>
      <para>For example, DirectML version <code>1.4.0</code> supports a feature level of <code>DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_3_0</code>. If the <i>RequestedFeatureLevels</i> array contained only <code>DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_1_0</code> and <code>DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_2_0</code>, then this query would return <code>DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_2_0</code>, which is lower than the true feature level (3_0) supported by the device.</para>
