  <member name="DML_TOP_K1_OPERATOR_DESC">
    <summary>
      <para>Selects the largest or smallest <i>K</i> elements from each sequence along an axis of the <i>InputTensor</i>, and returns the values and indices of those elements in the <i>OutputValueTensor</i> and <i>OutputIndexTensor</i>, respectively. A <i>sequence</i> refers to one of the sets of elements that exist along the <i>Axis</i> dimension of the <i>InputTensor</i>.</para>
      <para>The choice of whether to select the largest K elements or the smallest K elements can be controlled using <i>AxisDirection</i>.</para>

    <summary>The input tensor containing elements to select.</summary>

  <member name="DML_TOP_K1_OPERATOR_DESC.OutputValueTensor">
    <summary>
      <para>The output tensor to write the values of the top <i>K</i> elements to. The top <i>K</i> elements are selected based on whether they are the largest or the smallest, depending on the value of <i>AxisDirection</i>. This tensor must have sizes equal to the <i>InputTensor</i>, <i>except</i> for the dimension specified by the <i>Axis</i> parameter, which must have a size equal to <i>K</i>.</para>
      <para>The <i>K</i> values selected from each input sequence are guaranteed to be sorted descending (largest to smallest) if <i>AxisDirection</i> is <see cref="DML_AXIS_DIRECTION_DECREASING" />. Otherwise, the opposite is true and the values selected are guaranteed to be sorted ascending (smallest to largest).</para>

  <member name="DML_TOP_K1_OPERATOR_DESC.OutputIndexTensor">
    <summary>
      <para>The output tensor to write the indices of the top <i>K</i> elements to. This tensor must have sizes equal to the <i>InputTensor</i>, <i>except</i> for the dimension specified by the <i>Axis</i> parameter, which must have a size equal to <i>K</i>.</para>
      <para>The indices returned in this tensor are measured relative to the beginning of their sequence (as opposed to the beginning of the tensor). For example, an index of 0 always refers to the first element for all sequences in an axis.</para>
      <para>In cases where two or more elements in the top-K have the same value (that is, when there is a tie), the indices of both elements are included, and are guaranteed to be ordered by ascending element index. Note that this is true irrespective of the value of <i>AxisDirection</i>.</para>

    <summary>The index of the dimension to select elements across. This value must be less than the <i>DimensionCount</i> of the <i>InputTensor</i>.</summary>

    <summary>The number of elements to select. <i>K</i> must be greater than 0, but less than the number of elements in the <i>InputTensor</i> along the dimension specified by <i>Axis</i>.</summary>

    <summary>A value from the <see cref="DML_AXIS_DIRECTION" /> enumeration. If set to <b>DML_AXIS_DIRECTION_INCREASING</b>, then this operator returns the <i>smallest</i><i>K</i> elements in order of increasing value. Otherwise, it returns the <i>largest</i><i>K</i> elements in decreasing order.</summary>
