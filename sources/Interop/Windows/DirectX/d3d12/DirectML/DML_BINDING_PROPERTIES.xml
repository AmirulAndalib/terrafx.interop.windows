  <member name="DML_BINDING_PROPERTIES">
    <summary>Contains information about the binding requirements of a particular compiled operator, or operator initializer. This struct is retrieved from <see cref="IDMLDispatchable.GetBindingProperties" />.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DML_BINDING_PROPERTIES.RequiredDescriptorCount">
    <summary>The minimum size, in descriptors, of the binding table required for a particular dispatchable object (an operator initializer, or a compiled operator).</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DML_BINDING_PROPERTIES.TemporaryResourceSize">
    <summary>The minimum size in bytes of the temporary resource that must be bound to the binding table for a particular dispatchable object. A value of zero means that a temporary resource is not required.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DML_BINDING_PROPERTIES.PersistentResourceSize">
    <summary>The minimum size in bytes of the persistent resource that must be bound to the binding table for a particular dispatchable object. Persistent resources must be supplied during initialization of a compiled operator (where it is bound as an output of the operator initializer) as well as during execution. A value of zero means that a persistent resource is not required. Only compiled operators have persistent resources—operator initializers always return a value of 0 for this member.</summary>
