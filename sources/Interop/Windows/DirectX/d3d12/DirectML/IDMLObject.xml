  <member name="IDMLObject.GetPrivateData">
    <summary>Gets application-defined data from a DirectML device object. This method is thread-safe.</summary>
    <param name="guid">The <b>GUID</b> that is associated with the data.</param>
    <param name="dataSize">A pointer to a variable that on input contains the size, in bytes, of the buffer that <i>data</i> points to, and on output contains the size, in bytes, of the amount of data that <b>GetPrivateData</b> retrieved.</param>
    <param name="data">A pointer to a memory block that receives the data from the device object if <i>dataSize</i> points to a value that specifies a buffer large enough to hold the data.</param>
    <returns>If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.</returns>

  <member name="IDMLObject.SetName">
    <summary>Associates a name with the DirectML device object. This name is for use in debug diagnostics and tools. This method is thread-safe.</summary>
    <param name="name">A <b>NULL</b>-terminated <b>UNICODE</b> string that contains the name to associate with the DirectML device object.</param>

    <param name="dataSize">The size in bytes of the data.</param>
    <param name="data">A pointer to a memory block that contains the data to be stored with this DirectML device object.

  <member name="IDMLObject">
    <summary>An interface from which <see cref="IDMLDevice" /> and <see cref="IDMLDeviceChild" /> inherit directly (and all other interfaces, indirectly). Consequently, it provides methods common to all DirectML interfaces, specifically methods to associate private data, and to annotate object names. The <b>IDMLObject</b> interface inherits from the <see cref="IUnknown" /> interface.</summary>
