    <summary>
      <para>Computes the bitwise NOT for each element of the input tensor, and writes the result into the output tensor.</para>
      <para>The bitwise operation is applied to tensor data in its native encoding. Therefore, the tensor data type is ignored except for determining the width of each element.</para>
      <para>This operator supports in-place execution, meaning that the output tensor is permitted to alias the input tensor during binding.</para>
