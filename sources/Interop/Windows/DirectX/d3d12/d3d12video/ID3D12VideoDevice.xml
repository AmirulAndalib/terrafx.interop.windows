  <member name="ID3D12VideoDevice.CheckFeatureSupport">
    <summary>Gets information about the features that are supported by the current video driver.</summary>
    <param name="FeatureVideo">A member of the <see cref="D3D12_FEATURE_VIDEO" /> enumeration that specifies the feature to query for support.</param>
    <param name="pFeatureSupportData">A structure that contains data that describes the configuration details of the feature for which support is requested and, upon the completion of the call, is populated with details about the level of support available. For information on the structure that is associated with each type of feature support request, see the field descriptions for <see cref="D3D12_FEATURE_VIDEO" />.</param>
    <param name="FeatureSupportDataSize">The size of the structure passed to the <i>pFeatureSupportData</i> parameter.</param>
    <returns>Returns <b>S_OK</b> if successful; otherwise, returns <b>E_INVALIDARG</b> if an unsupported data type is passed to the <i>pFeatureSupportData</i> parameter or a size mismatch is detected for the <i>FeatureSupportDataSize</i> parameter.</returns>

  <member name="ID3D12VideoDevice.CreateVideoDecoder">
    <summary>Creates a video decoder instance that contains the resolution-independent driver resources and state.</summary>
    <param name="pDesc">A pointer to a <see cref="D3D12_VIDEO_DECODER_DESC" /> structure describing the decode profile and bitstream encryption for the decoder.</param>
    <param name="riid">The globally unique identifier (GUID) for the decode video state interface.</param>
    <param name="ppVideoDecoder">A pointer to a memory block that receives a pointer to the <see cref="ID3D12VideoDecoder" /> interface.</param>
    <returns>This method returns HRESULT.</returns>

  <member name="ID3D12VideoDevice.CreateVideoDecoderHeap">
    <summary>Allocates a video decoder heap that contains the resolution-dependent driver resources and state.</summary>
    <param name="pVideoDecoderHeapDesc">A pointer to a <see cref="D3D12_VIDEO_DECODER_HEAP_DESC" /> describing the decoding configuration.</param>
    <param name="riid">The globally unique identifier (GUID) for the decode video state interface.</param>

  <member name="ID3D12VideoDevice.CreateVideoProcessor">
    <summary>Creates a video processor instance.</summary>
    <param name="NodeMask">The node mask specifying the physical adapter on which the video processor will be used. For single GPU operation, set this to zero. If there are multiple GPU nodes, set a bit to identify the node, i.e. the device's physical adapter, to which the command queue applies. Each bit in the mask corresponds to a single node. Only 1 bit may be set.</param>
    <param name="pOutputStreamDesc">A pointer to a D3D12_VIDEO_PROCESS_OUTPUT_STREAM_DESC(ns-d3d12video-d3d12_video_process_output_stream_desc) structure describing the output stream.</param>
