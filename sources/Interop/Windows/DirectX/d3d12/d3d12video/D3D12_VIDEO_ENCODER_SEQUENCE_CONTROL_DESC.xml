      <para>A <see cref="D3D12_VIDEO_ENCODER_INTRA_REFRESH" /> structure specifying the parameters for the intra-refresh mode that should be used when triggering intra-refresh sessions.</para>
      <para>The use of bidirectional reference frames (B Frames) is mutually exclusive with intra-refresh. Callers should verify that the GOP structure doesn't contain B frames if intra-refresh modes are active. When querying for <see cref="D3D12_FEATURE_DATA_VIDEO_ENCODER_SUPPORT" /> with an intra-refresh mode other than <see cref="D3D12_VIDEO_ENCODER_INTRA_REFRESH_MODE_NONE" />, the specified <see cref="D3D12_VIDEO_ENCODER_SEQUENCE_GOP_STRUCTURE" /> set must not contain B frames, or the query will return no support.</para>
      <para>The usage of infinite intra-refresh is possible by requesting periodically a new wave of intra-refresh after each of them finishes.</para>
      <para>When starting an intra-refresh of N frames of duration, the hosts sets the corresponding picture control flag to start intra-refresh and controls the frame index between [0..N) also in the picture control structure to hint the driver about the progress about the intra refresh session.</para>
      <para>Expected behaviour when explicitly requesting an intra refresh wave with duration N frames:</para>
      <list type="bullet">
        <item>
          <description>If the request for intra-refresh happens at the beginning of a GOP, the intra refresh ocurrs for N frames and then a new GOP is started with an I frame.</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>If the request for intra-refresh happens in the middle of a GOP, the group of pictures will be ended until the last <b>EncodeFrame</b> command submitted and restarted after the intra-refresh session with a new GOP starting with an I frame. For example, when the GOP is IPPPP...IPPPP..., if the intra-refresh start is requested at the "IPP" partial submission of the GOP, the last two P frames of that GOP will be ignored, the intra-refresh session will be issued for the N next frames and then a new key-frame that restarts the GOP structure is expected.</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>For row-based intra-refresh, the configured GOP structure will have to be reconfigured to Infinite IPPP...P... GOP (GOPLength = 0u and PPicturePeriod = 1u) for the duration of the intra refresh session. It can then be reconfigured again after the IR wave finished.</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <description>For row based intra-refresh, the configured subregion partitioning mode will be reconfigured to correspond with N uniform slices partitioning per frame for a duration of N <b>EncodeFrame</b> commands. This is particularly important for when the subregion partitioning is set to an incompatible mode with IR requirements, for example when the row of intra coded units in a slice will disrupt the limitation set to bytes per slice. The expectation for row-based intra refresh is that the resulting frame contains N slices, all P slices, except the current intra refresh row slice, which has to be an I slice.</description>

      <para>For some codecs, A change in resolution in the middle of the encoding session might require a GOP to be reset with a potential force IDR/Key frame request, and also might require resetting the DPB buffer/frame management algorithms.</para>
