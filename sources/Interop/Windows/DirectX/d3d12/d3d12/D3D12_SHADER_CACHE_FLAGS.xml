  <member name="D3D12_SHADER_CACHE_FLAGS.D3D12_SHADER_CACHE_FLAG_DRIVER_VERSIONED">
    <summary>Specifies that the cache is implicitly versioned by the driver being used. For multi-GPU systems, a cache created this way is stored side by side for each adapter on which the application runs. The <i>Version</i> field in the <see cref="D3D12_SHADER_CACHE_SESSION_DESC" /> struct (the cache description) is used as an additional constraint.</summary>

  <member name="D3D12_SHADER_CACHE_FLAGS.D3D12_SHADER_CACHE_FLAG_USE_WORKING_DIR">
    <summary>By default, caches are stored in temporary storage, and can be cleared by disk cleanup. This constant (not valid for UWP apps) specifies that the cache is instead stored in the current working directory.</summary>
