  <member name="D3D12_MEMORY_POOL.D3D12_MEMORY_POOL_L0">
    <summary>
      <para>The memory pool is L0.
L0 is the physical system memory pool.
When the adapter is discrete/NUMA, this pool has greater bandwidth for the CPU and less bandwidth for the GPU.
When the adapter is UMA, this pool is the only one which is valid.</para>

  <member name="D3D12_MEMORY_POOL.D3D12_MEMORY_POOL_L1">
    <summary>
      <para>The memory pool is L1.
L1 is typically known as the physical video memory pool.
L1 is only available when the adapter is discrete/NUMA, and has greater bandwidth for the GPU and cannot even be accessed by the CPU.
When the adapter is UMA, this pool is not available.</para>
