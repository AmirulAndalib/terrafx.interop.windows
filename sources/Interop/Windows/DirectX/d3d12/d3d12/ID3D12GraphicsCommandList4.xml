      <para>The address of the acceleration structure or other type of data to copy/transform based on the specified <i>Mode</i>. The data remains unchanged and usable. The operation only copies the data pointed to by <i>SourceAccelerationStructureData</i> and not any other data, such as acceleration structures, that the source data may point to. For example, in the case of a top-level acceleration structure, any bottom-level acceleration structures that it points to are not copied in the operation.</para>
