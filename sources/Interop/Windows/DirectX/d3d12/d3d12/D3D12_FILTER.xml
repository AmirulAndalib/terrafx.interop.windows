      <para>Specifies filtering options during texture sampling.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>This enum is used by the <see cref="D3D12_SAMPLER_DESC" /> structure.</para>
      <para>
        <b>Note</b>  If you use different filter types for min versus mag filter, undefined behavior occurs in certain cases where the choice between whether magnification or minification happens is ambiguous.  To prevent this undefined behavior, use filter modes that use similar filter operations for both min and mag (or use anisotropic filtering, which avoids the issue as well).</para>
      <para>During texture sampling, one or more texels are read and combined (this is calling filtering) to produce a single value. Point sampling reads a single texel while linear sampling reads two texels (endpoints) and linearly interpolates a third value between the endpoints.</para>
      <para>Microsoft High Level Shader Language (HLSL) texture-sampling functions also support comparison filtering during texture sampling. Comparison filtering compares each sampled texel against a comparison value. The boolean result is blended the same way that normal texture filtering is blended.</para>
      <para>You can use HLSL intrinsic texture-sampling functions that implement texture filtering only or companion functions that use texture filtering with comparison filtering.</para>
