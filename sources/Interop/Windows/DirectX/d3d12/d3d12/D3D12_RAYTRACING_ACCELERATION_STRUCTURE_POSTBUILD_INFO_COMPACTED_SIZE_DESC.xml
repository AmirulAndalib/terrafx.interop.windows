    <summary>
      <para>The space requirement for acceleration structure after compaction.</para>
      <para>It is guaranteed that a compacted acceleration structure doesn’t consume more space than a non-compacted acceleration structure.</para>
      <para>Pre-compaction, it is guaranteed that the size requirements reported by <see cref="GetRaytracingAccelerationStructurePrebuildInfo" /> for a given build configuration (triangle counts etc.) will be sufficient to store any acceleration structure whose build inputs are reduced (e.g. reducing triangle counts).  This non-increasing property for smaller builds does not apply post-compaction, however.  In other words, it is not guaranteed that having fewer items in an acceleration structure means it compresses to a smaller size than compressing an acceleration structure with more items.</para>
