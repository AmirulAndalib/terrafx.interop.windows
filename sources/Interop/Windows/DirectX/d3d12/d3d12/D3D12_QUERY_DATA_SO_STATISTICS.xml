  <member name="D3D12_QUERY_DATA_SO_STATISTICS.PrimitivesStorageNeeded">
    <summary>If the stream output resource is large enough, then <i>PrimitivesStorageNeeded</i> represents the total number of primitives written to the stream output resource. Otherwise, it represents the total number of primitives that <i>would</i> have been written to the stream-output resource had there been enough space for them all.</summary>
