  <member name="D3D12_SAMPLER_DESC.Filter">
    <summary>A <see cref="D3D12_FILTER" />-typed value that specifies the filtering method to use when sampling a texture.</summary>

    <summary>A <see cref="D3D12_TEXTURE_ADDRESS_MODE" />-typed value that specifies the method to use for resolving a u texture coordinate that is outside the 0 to 1 range.</summary>

    <summary>A <see cref="D3D12_TEXTURE_ADDRESS_MODE" />-typed value that specifies the method to use for resolving a v texture coordinate that is outside the 0 to 1 range.</summary>

  <member name="D3D12_SAMPLER_DESC.MipLODBias">
    <summary>Offset from the calculated mipmap level. For example, if the runtime calculates that a texture should be sampled at mipmap level 3 and <b>MipLODBias</b> is 2, the texture will be sampled at mipmap level 5.</summary>

    <summary>Clamping value used if <b>D3D12_FILTER_ANISOTROPIC</b> or <b>D3D12_FILTER_COMPARISON_ANISOTROPIC</b> is specified in <b>Filter</b>. Valid values are between 1 and 16.</summary>

  <member name="D3D12_SAMPLER_DESC.ComparisonFunc">
    <summary>A <see cref="D3D12_COMPARISON_FUNC" />-typed value that specifies a function that compares sampled data against existing sampled data.</summary>

    <summary>RGBA border color to use if <see cref="D3D12_TEXTURE_ADDRESS_MODE_BORDER" /> is specified for <b>AddressU</b>, <b>AddressV</b>, or <b>AddressW</b>. Range must be between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive.</summary>

  <member name="D3D12_SAMPLER_DESC.MinLOD">
    <summary>Lower end of the mipmap range to clamp access to, where 0 is the largest and most detailed mipmap level and any level higher than that is less detailed.</summary>

  <member name="D3D12_SAMPLER_DESC.MaxLOD">
    <summary>Upper end of the mipmap range to clamp access to, where 0 is the largest and most detailed mipmap level and any level higher than that is less detailed. This value must be greater than or equal to <b>MinLOD</b>. To have no upper limit on LOD, set this member to a large value.</summary>
