    <summary>
      <para>Defines priority levels for a command queue.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>This enumeration is used by the <b>Priority</b> member of the
<see cref="D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_DESC" /> structure.</para>
      <para>An application must be sufficiently privileged in order to create a command queue that has global realtime priority. If the application is not sufficiently privileged or if neither the adapter or driver can provide the necessary preemption, then requests to create a global realtime priority queue fail; such a failure could be due to a lack of hardware support or due to conflicts with other command queue parameters. Requests to create a global realtime command queue won't silently downgrade the priority when it can't be supported; the request succeeds or fails as-is to indicate to the application whether or not the command queue is guaranteed to execute before any other queue.</para>
