      <para>Get a boolean value that indicates the type of device being used.</para>

      <para>Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">BOOL</a></b></para>
      <para>
        <b>TRUE</b> if the device is a software device, <b>FALSE</b> if the device is a hardware device. See remarks.</para>
    </returns>
    <remarks>
      <para>A hardware device is commonly referred to as a HAL device, which stands for a hardware accelerated device. This means that the pipeline is rendering all of the pipeline commands in hardware, using the GPU. Operating the pipeline with a HAL device gives the best performance generally, but it can be more difficult to debug since resources exist on the GPU instead of the CPU.</para>
      <para>A software device implements rendering in software using the CPU with no hardware acceleration. A software device is commonly referred to as a reference device or REF device. Because a REF device implements rendering on the CPU, it is generally slower, but is easier to debug since it allows access to resources.</para>

    <remarks>
      <para>This API will fail if the device is not switchable; you must have created a device that is switchable by specifying the D3D10_CREATE_DEVICE_SWITCH_TO_REF flag during device creation (when calling <see cref="D3D10CreateDevice" />).</para>
      <para>Switching from a software device to a hardware device clears all cached objects from system memory. Switching from a hardware device to a software device causes resources to be downloaded to system memory.</para>
