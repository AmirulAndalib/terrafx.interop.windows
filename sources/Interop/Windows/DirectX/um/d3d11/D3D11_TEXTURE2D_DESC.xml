    <summary>Describes a 2D texture.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D3D11_TEXTURE2D_DESC.Width">
    <summary>Texture width (in texels). The range is from 1 to D3D11_REQ_TEXTURE2D_U_OR_V_DIMENSION (16384). For a texture cube-map, the range is from 1 to D3D11_REQ_TEXTURECUBE_DIMENSION (16384). However, the range is actually constrained by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/direct3d11/overviews-direct3d-11-devices-downlevel-intro">feature level</a> at which you create the rendering device. For more information about restrictions, see Remarks.</summary>

  <member name="D3D11_TEXTURE2D_DESC.Height">
    <summary>Texture height (in texels). The range is from 1 to D3D11_REQ_TEXTURE2D_U_OR_V_DIMENSION (16384). For a texture cube-map, the range is from 1 to D3D11_REQ_TEXTURECUBE_DIMENSION (16384).

  <member name="D3D11_TEXTURE2D_DESC.MipLevels">
    <summary>The maximum number of mipmap levels in the texture. See the remarks in <see cref="D3D11_TEX1D_SRV" />. Use 1 for a multisampled texture; or 0 to generate a full set of subtextures.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D3D11_TEXTURE2D_DESC.ArraySize">
    <summary>Number of textures in the texture array. The range is from 1 to D3D11_REQ_TEXTURE2D_ARRAY_AXIS_DIMENSION (2048). For a texture cube-map, this value is a multiple of 6 (that is, 6 times the value in the <b>NumCubes</b> member of <see cref="D3D11_TEXCUBE_ARRAY_SRV" />), and the range is from 6 to 2046. The range is actually constrained by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/direct3d11/overviews-direct3d-11-devices-downlevel-intro">feature level</a> at which you create the rendering device. For more information about restrictions, see Remarks.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D3D11_TEXTURE2D_DESC.Format">
    <summary>Texture format (see <see cref="DXGI_FORMAT" />).</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D3D11_TEXTURE2D_DESC.SampleDesc">
    <summary>Structure that specifies multisampling parameters for the texture. See <see cref="DXGI_SAMPLE_DESC" />.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D3D11_TEXTURE2D_DESC.Usage">
    <summary>Value that identifies how the texture is to be read from and written to. The most common value is D3D11_USAGE_DEFAULT; see <see cref="D3D11_USAGE" /> for all possible values.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D3D11_TEXTURE2D_DESC.BindFlags">
    <summary>Flags (see <see cref="D3D11_BIND_FLAG" />) for binding to pipeline stages. The flags can be combined by a bitwise OR.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D3D11_TEXTURE2D_DESC.CPUAccessFlags">
    <summary>Flags (see <see cref="D3D11_CPU_ACCESS_FLAG" />) to specify the types of CPU access allowed. Use 0 if CPU access is not required. These flags can be combined with a bitwise OR.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D3D11_TEXTURE2D_DESC.MiscFlags">
    <summary>Flags (see <see cref="D3D11_RESOURCE_MISC_FLAG" />) that identify other, less common resource options. Use 0 if none of these flags apply. These flags can be combined by using a bitwise OR. For a texture cube-map, set the <see cref="D3D11_RESOURCE_MISC_TEXTURECUBE" /> flag. Cube-map arrays (that is, <b>ArraySize</b> &gt; 6) require feature level <see cref="D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_10_1" /> or higher.</summary>
