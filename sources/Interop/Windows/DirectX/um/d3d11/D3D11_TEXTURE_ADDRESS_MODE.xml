    <summary>Identify a technique for resolving texture coordinates that are outside of the boundaries of a texture.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D3D11_TEXTURE_ADDRESS_MODE.D3D11_TEXTURE_ADDRESS_WRAP">
    <summary>Tile the texture at every (u,v) integer junction. For example, for u values between 0 and 3, the texture is repeated three times.</summary>

  <member name="D3D11_TEXTURE_ADDRESS_MODE.D3D11_TEXTURE_ADDRESS_MIRROR">
    <summary>Flip the texture at every (u,v) integer junction. For u values between 0 and 1, for example, the texture is addressed normally; between 1 and 2, the texture is flipped (mirrored); between 2 and 3, the texture is normal again; and so on.</summary>

    <summary>Texture coordinates outside the range [0.0, 1.0] are set to the texture color at 0.0 or 1.0, respectively.</summary>

  <member name="D3D11_TEXTURE_ADDRESS_MODE.D3D11_TEXTURE_ADDRESS_BORDER">
    <summary>Texture coordinates outside the range [0.0, 1.0] are set to the border color specified in <see cref="D3D11_SAMPLER_DESC" /> or HLSL code.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D3D11_TEXTURE_ADDRESS_MODE.D3D11_TEXTURE_ADDRESS_MIRROR_ONCE">
    <summary>Similar to D3D11_TEXTURE_ADDRESS_MIRROR and D3D11_TEXTURE_ADDRESS_CLAMP. Takes the absolute value of the texture coordinate (thus, mirroring around 0), and then clamps to the maximum value.</summary>
