  <member name="D3D11_FEATURE_DATA_D3D11_OPTIONS1.TiledResourcesTier">
    <summary>Specifies whether the hardware and driver support tiled resources. The runtime sets this member to a <see cref="D3D11_TILED_RESOURCES_TIER" />-typed value that indicates if the hardware and driver support tiled resources and at what tier level.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D3D11_FEATURE_DATA_D3D11_OPTIONS1.MinMaxFiltering">
    <summary>Specifies whether the hardware and driver support the filtering options (<see cref="D3D11_FILTER" />) of comparing the result to the minimum or maximum value during texture sampling. The runtime sets this member to <b>TRUE</b> if the hardware and driver support these filtering options.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D3D11_FEATURE_DATA_D3D11_OPTIONS1.ClearViewAlsoSupportsDepthOnlyFormats">
    <summary>Specifies whether the hardware and driver also support the <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext1.ClearView" /> method on depth formats. For info about valid depth formats, see <see cref="D3D11_DEPTH_STENCIL_VIEW_DESC" />.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D3D11_FEATURE_DATA_D3D11_OPTIONS1.MapOnDefaultBuffers">
    <summary>Specifies support for creating <see cref="ID3D11Buffer" /> resources that can be passed to the <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext.Map" /> and <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext.Unmap" /> methods. This means that the <b>CPUAccessFlags</b> member of the <see cref="D3D11_BUFFER_DESC" /> structure may be set with the desired <see cref="D3D11_CPU_ACCESS_FLAG" /> elements when the <b>Usage</b> member of <b>D3D11_BUFFER_DESC</b> is set to <b>D3D11_USAGE_DEFAULT</b>. The runtime sets this member to <b>TRUE</b> if the hardware is capable of at least <b>D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_11_0</b> and the graphics device driver supports mappable default buffers.</summary>
