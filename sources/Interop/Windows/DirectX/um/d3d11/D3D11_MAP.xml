      <para>Resource is mapped for writing; the existing contents of the resource cannot be overwritten (see Remarks). This flag is only valid on vertex and index buffers. The resource must have been created with write access (see <see cref="D3D11_CPU_ACCESS_WRITE" />). Cannot be used on a resource created with the <see cref="D3D11_BIND_CONSTANT_BUFFER" /> flag.</para>

        <b>Note</b>  The Direct3D 11.1 runtime, which is available starting with Windows 8, enables mapping dynamic constant buffers and shader resource views (SRVs) of dynamic buffers with <see cref="D3D11_MAP_WRITE_NO_OVERWRITE" />. The Direct3D 11 and earlier runtimes limited mapping to vertex or index buffers. To determine if a Direct3D device supports these features, call <see cref="ID3D11Device.CheckFeatureSupport" /> with <see cref="D3D11_FEATURE_D3D11_OPTIONS" />. <b>CheckFeatureSupport</b> fills members of a <see cref="D3D11_FEATURE_DATA_D3D11_OPTIONS" /> structure with the device's features. The relevant members here are <b>MapNoOverwriteOnDynamicConstantBuffer</b> and <b>MapNoOverwriteOnDynamicBufferSRV</b>.</div>
