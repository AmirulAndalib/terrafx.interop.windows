    <summary>
      <para>A predicate interface determines whether geometry should be processed depending on the results of a previous draw call.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>To create a predicate object, call <see cref="ID3D11Device.CreatePredicate" />. To set the predicate object, call <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext.SetPredication" />.</para>
      <para>There are two types of predicates: stream-output-overflow predicates and occlusion predicates. Stream-output-overflow predicates cause any geometry residing in stream-output buffers that were overflowed to not be processed. Occlusion predicates cause any geometry that did not have a single sample pass the depth/stencil tests to not be processed.</para>
