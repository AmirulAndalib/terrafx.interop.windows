    <param name="byteWidth">Size of the buffer in bytes.</param>
    <param name="bindFlags">A combination of <see cref="D3D11_BIND_FLAG" /> values that are combined by using a bitwise OR operation. The resulting value identifies how the buffer will be bound to the pipeline.</param>
    <param name="usage">A <see cref="D3D11_USAGE" />-typed value that identifies how the buffer is expected to be read from and written to. Frequency of update is a key factor.</param>
    <param name="cpuaccessFlags">A combination of <see cref="D3D11_CPU_ACCESS_FLAG" /> values that are combined by using a bitwise OR operation or 0 if no CPU access is necessary. The resulting value identifies CPU access.</param>
    <param name="miscFlags">A combination of <see cref="D3D11_RESOURCE_MISC_FLAG" /> values that are combined by using a bitwise OR operation or 0 if unused. The resulting value identifies miscellaneous buffer info.</param>
    <param name="structureByteStride">
      <para>The size of each element in the buffer structure (in bytes) when the buffer represents a structured buffer. For more info about structured buffers, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/direct3d11/direct3d-11-advanced-stages-cs-resources">Structured Buffer</a>.</para>
      <para>The size value in <i>structureByteStride</i> must match the size of the format that you use for views of the buffer. For example, if you use a shader resource view (SRV) to read a buffer in a pixel shader, the SRV format size must match the size value in <i>structureByteStride</i>.</para>
