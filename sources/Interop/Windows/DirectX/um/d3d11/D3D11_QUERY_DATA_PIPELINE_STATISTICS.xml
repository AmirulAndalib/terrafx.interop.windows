    <summary>Query information about graphics-pipeline activity in between calls to <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext.Begin" /> and <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext.End" />.</summary>

  <member name="D3D11_QUERY_DATA_PIPELINE_STATISTICS.IAVertices">
    <summary>Number of vertices read by input assembler.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D3D11_QUERY_DATA_PIPELINE_STATISTICS.IAPrimitives">
    <summary>Number of primitives read by the input assembler. This number can be different depending on the primitive topology used. For example, a triangle strip with 6 vertices will produce 4 triangles, however a triangle list with 6 vertices will produce 2 triangles.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D3D11_QUERY_DATA_PIPELINE_STATISTICS.VSInvocations">
    <summary>Number of times a vertex shader was invoked. Direct3D invokes the vertex shader once per vertex.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D3D11_QUERY_DATA_PIPELINE_STATISTICS.GSInvocations">
    <summary>Number of times a geometry shader was invoked. When the geometry shader is set to <b>NULL</b>, this statistic may or may not increment depending on the hardware manufacturer.</summary>

    <summary>Number of primitives output by a geometry shader.</summary>

  <member name="D3D11_QUERY_DATA_PIPELINE_STATISTICS.CInvocations">
    <summary>Number of primitives that were sent to the rasterizer. When the rasterizer is disabled, this will not increment.</summary>

  <member name="D3D11_QUERY_DATA_PIPELINE_STATISTICS.CPrimitives">
    <summary>Number of primitives that were rendered. This may be larger or smaller than CInvocations because after a primitive is clipped sometimes it is either broken up into more than one primitive or completely culled.</summary>

    <summary>Number of times a pixel shader was invoked.</summary>

    <summary>Number of times a hull shader was invoked.</summary>
