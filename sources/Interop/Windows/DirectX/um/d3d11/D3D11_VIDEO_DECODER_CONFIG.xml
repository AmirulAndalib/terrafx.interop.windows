  <member name="D3D11_VIDEO_DECODER_CONFIG.ConfigBitstreamRaw">
    <summary>Indicates whether the host-decoder sends raw bit-stream data. If the value is 1, the data for the pictures will be sent in bit-stream buffers as raw bit-stream content. If the value is 0, picture data will be sent using macroblock control command buffers. If either <b>ConfigResidDiffHost</b> or <b>ConfigResidDiffAccelerator</b> is 1, the value must be 0.</summary>

  <member name="D3D11_VIDEO_DECODER_CONFIG.ConfigMBcontrolRasterOrder">
    <summary>Specifies whether macroblock control commands are in raster scan order or in arbitrary order. If the value is 1, the macroblock control commands within each macroblock control command buffer are in raster-scan order. If the value is 0, the order is arbitrary. For some types of bit streams, forcing raster order either greatly increases the number of required macroblock control buffers that must be processed, or requires host reordering of the control information. Therefore, supporting arbitrary order can be more efficient.</summary>

      <para>The ability to subtract differences rather than add them enables 8-bit difference decoding to be fully compliant with the full ±255 range of values required in video decoder specifications, because +255 cannot be represented as the addition of two signed 8-bit numbers, but any number in the range ±255 can be represented as the difference between two signed 8-bit numbers (+255 = +127 minus –128).</para>
