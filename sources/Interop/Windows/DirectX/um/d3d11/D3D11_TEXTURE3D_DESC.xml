  <member name="D3D11_TEXTURE3D_DESC.Width">
    <summary>Texture width (in texels). The range is from 1 to D3D11_REQ_TEXTURE3D_U_V_OR_W_DIMENSION (2048). However, the range is actually constrained by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/direct3d11/overviews-direct3d-11-devices-downlevel-intro">feature level</a> at which you create the rendering device. For more information about restrictions, see Remarks.</summary>

  <member name="D3D11_TEXTURE3D_DESC.MipLevels">
    <summary>The maximum number of mipmap levels in the texture. See the remarks in <see cref="D3D11_TEX1D_SRV" />. Use 1 for a multisampled texture; or 0 to generate a full set of subtextures.</summary>

  <member name="D3D11_TEXTURE3D_DESC.Format">
    <summary>Texture format (see <see cref="DXGI_FORMAT" />).</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D3D11_TEXTURE3D_DESC.Usage">
    <summary>Value that identifies how the texture is to be read from and written to. The most common value is D3D11_USAGE_DEFAULT; see <see cref="D3D11_USAGE" /> for all possible values.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D3D11_TEXTURE3D_DESC.BindFlags">
    <summary>Flags (see <see cref="D3D11_BIND_FLAG" />) for binding to pipeline stages. The flags can be combined by a bitwise OR.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D3D11_TEXTURE3D_DESC.CPUAccessFlags">
    <summary>Flags (see <see cref="D3D11_CPU_ACCESS_FLAG" />) to specify the types of CPU access allowed. Use 0 if CPU access is not required. These flags can be combined with a bitwise OR.</summary>

  <member name="D3D11_TEXTURE3D_DESC.MiscFlags">
    <summary>Flags (see <see cref="D3D11_RESOURCE_MISC_FLAG" />) that identify other, less common resource options. Use 0 if none of these flags apply. These flags can be combined with a bitwise OR.</summary>
