      <para>Specifies the types of CPU access allowed for a resource.</para>

      <para>This enumeration is used in <see cref="D3D11_BUFFER_DESC" />, <see cref="D3D11_TEXTURE1D_DESC" />, <see cref="D3D11_TEXTURE2D_DESC" />, <see cref="D3D11_TEXTURE3D_DESC" />.</para>
      <para>Applications may combine one or more of these flags with a bitwise OR. When possible, create resources with no CPU access flags, as this enables better resource optimization.</para>
      <para>The <see cref="D3D11_RESOURCE_MISC_FLAG" /> cannot be used when creating resources with <b>D3D11_CPU_ACCESS</b> flags.</para>
