      <para>An application identifies the way a resource is intended to be used (its usage) in a resource description. There are several structures for creating resources including: <see cref="D3D11_TEXTURE1D_DESC" />, <see cref="D3D11_TEXTURE2D_DESC" />, <see cref="D3D11_TEXTURE3D_DESC" />, and <see cref="D3D11_BUFFER_DESC" />.</para>

            <para>Differences between Direct3D 9 and Direct3D 10/11:</para>
            <para>In Direct3D 9, you specify the type of memory a resource should be created in at resource creation time (using D3DPOOL). It was an application's job to decide what memory pool would provide the best combination of functionality and performance.</para>
            <para>In Direct3D 10/11, an application no longer specifies what type of memory (the pool) to create a resource in. Instead, you specify the intended usage of the resource, and let the runtime (in concert with the driver and a memory manager) choose the type of memory that will achieve the best performance.</para>

      <h3>Resource Usage Restrictions</h3>
      <para>Each usage dictates a tradeoff between accessibility for the CPU and accessibility for the GPU. In general, higher-performance access for one of these two processors means lower-performance access for the other. At either extreme are the <b>D3D11_USAGE_DEFAULT</b> and <b>D3D11_USAGE_STAGING</b> usages. <b>D3D11_USAGE_DEFAULT</b> restricts access almost entirely to the GPU. <b>D3D11_USAGE_STAGING</b> restricts access almost entirely to the CPU and allows only a data transfer (copy) of a resource between the GPU and the CPU. You can perform these copy operations via the <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext.CopySubresourceRegion" /> and <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext.CopyResource" /> methods. You can also use these copy methods to copy data between two resources of the same usage. You can also use the <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext.UpdateSubresource" /> method to copy memory directly from a CPU-supplied pointer to any resource, most usefully a resource with <b>D3D11_USAGE_DEFAULT</b>.</para>
      <para>
        <b>D3D11_USAGE_DYNAMIC</b> usage is a special case that optimizes the flow of data from CPU to GPU when the CPU generates that data on-the-fly and sends that data with high frequency. <b>D3D11_USAGE_DYNAMIC</b> is typically used on resources with vertex data and on constant buffers. Use the <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext.Map" /> and <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext.Unmap" /> methods to write data to these resources. To achieve the highest performance for data consumed serially, like vertex data, use the <b>D3D11_MAP_WRITE_NO_OVERWRITE</b> and <b>D3D11_MAP_WRITE_DISCARD</b> sequence. For more info about this sequence, see <see cref="Common Usage of D3D11_MAP_WRITE_DISCARD with D3D11_MAP_WRITE_NO_OVERWRITE" />.</para>
      <para>
        <b>D3D11_USAGE_IMMUTABLE</b> usage is another special case that causes the GPU to generate data just once when you create a resource. <b>D3D11_USAGE_IMMUTABLE</b> is well-suited to data such as textures because such data is typically read into memory from some file format. Therefore, when you create a texture with <b>D3D11_USAGE_IMMUTABLE</b>, the GPU directly reads that texture into memory.</para>
      <para>Use the following table to choose the usage that best describes how the resource will need to be accessed by the CPU and/or the GPU. Of course, there will be performance tradeoffs.</para>

      <para>1 - GPU read or write of a resource with the <b>D3D11_USAGE_STAGING</b> usage is restricted to copy operations. You use <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext.CopySubresourceRegion" /> and <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext.CopyResource" /> for these copy operations. Also, because depth-stencil formats and multisample layouts are implementation details of a particular GPU design, the operating system can’t expose these formats and layouts to the CPU in general. Therefore, staging resources can't be a depth-stencil buffer or a multisampled render target.</para>
      <para>
        <b>Note</b>  You can technically use <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext.UpdateSubresource" /> to copy to a resource with any usage except <b>D3D11_USAGE_IMMUTABLE</b>. However, we recommend to use <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext.UpdateSubresource" /> to update only a resource with <b>D3D11_USAGE_DEFAULT</b>. We recommend to use <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext.Map" /> and <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext.Unmap" /> to update resources with <b>D3D11_USAGE_DYNAMIC</b> because that is the specific purpose of <b>D3D11_USAGE_DYNAMIC</b> resources, and is therefore the most optimized path.</para>
      <para>
        <b>Note</b>  <b>D3D11_USAGE_DYNAMIC</b> resources consume specific hardware capabilities. Therefore, use them sparingly. The display driver typically allocates memory for <b>D3D11_USAGE_DYNAMIC</b> resources with a caching algorithm that favors CPU writes and hinders CPU reads. Furthermore, the memory behind <b>D3D11_USAGE_DYNAMIC</b> resources might not even be the same for successive calls to <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext.Map" />. Therefore, do not expect high performance or even consistent CPU reads from <b>D3D11_USAGE_DYNAMIC</b> resources.</para>
      <para>
        <b>Note</b>  <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext.CopyStructureCount" /> is a special case of GPU-to-CPU copy. Use <b>ID3D11DeviceContext.CopyStructureCount</b> only with unordered access views (UAVs) of buffers.</para>
