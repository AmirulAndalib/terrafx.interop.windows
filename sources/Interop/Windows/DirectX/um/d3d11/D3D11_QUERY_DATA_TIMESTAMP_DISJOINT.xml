    <summary>If this is <b>TRUE</b>, something occurred in between the query's <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext.Begin" /> and <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext.End" /> calls that caused the timestamp counter to become discontinuous or disjoint, such as unplugging the AC cord on a laptop, overheating, or throttling up/down due to laptop savings events. The timestamp returned by <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext.GetData" /> for a timestamp query is only reliable if <b>Disjoint</b> is <b>FALSE</b>.</summary>
