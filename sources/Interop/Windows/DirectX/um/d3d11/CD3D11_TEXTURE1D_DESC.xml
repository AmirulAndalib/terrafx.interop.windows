    <param name="format">A <see cref="DXGI_FORMAT" />-typed value that specifies the texture format.</param>
    <param name="width">Texture width (in texels). The range is from 1 to <b>D3D11_REQ_TEXTURE1D_U_DIMENSION</b> (16384). However, the range is actually constrained by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/direct3d11/overviews-direct3d-11-devices-downlevel-intro">feature level</a> at which you create the rendering device.</param>
    <param name="arraySize">Number of textures in the array. The range is from 1 to <b>D3D11_REQ_TEXTURE1D_ARRAY_AXIS_DIMENSION</b> (2048). However, the range is actually constrained by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/direct3d11/overviews-direct3d-11-devices-downlevel-intro">feature level</a> at which you create the rendering device.</param>
    <param name="mipLevels">The maximum number of mipmap levels in the texture. See the remarks in <see cref="D3D11_TEX1D_SRV" />. Use 1 for a multisampled texture; or 0 to generate a full set of subtextures.</param>
    <param name="bindFlags">A combination of <see cref="D3D11_BIND_FLAG" />-typed values that are combined by using a bitwise OR operation. The resulting value specifies how to bind the texture to pipeline stages. For a 1D texture, the allowable values are: D3D11_BIND_SHADER_RESOURCE, D3D11_BIND_RENDER_TARGET and D3D11_BIND_DEPTH_STENCIL.</param>
    <param name="usage">A <see cref="D3D11_USAGE" />-typed value that identifies how the texture is to be read from and written to.</param>
    <param name="cpuaccessFlags">A combination of <see cref="D3D11_CPU_ACCESS_FLAG" />-typed values that are combined by using a bitwise OR operation. The resulting value specifies the types of CPU access allowed.</param>
    <param name="miscFlags">A combination of <see cref="D3D11_RESOURCE_MISC_FLAG" />-typed values that are combined by using a bitwise OR operation. The resulting value identifies other, less common resource options.</param>
