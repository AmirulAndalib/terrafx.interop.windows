  <member name="DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS">
    <summary>Specifies algorithmic style simulations to be applied to the font face. Bold and oblique simulations can be combined via bitwise OR operation.</summary>

  <member name="DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS.DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS_NONE">
    <summary>Indicates that no simulations are applied to the font face.</summary>

  <member name="DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS.DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS_BOLD">
    <summary>Indicates that algorithmic emboldening is applied to the font face. <see cref="DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS_BOLD" /> increases weight by applying a widening algorithm to the glyph outline. This may be used to simulate a bold weight where no designed bold weight is available.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS.DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS_OBLIQUE">
    <summary>Indicates that algorithmic italicization is applied to the font face. <see cref="DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS_OBLIQUE" /> applies obliquing (shear) to the glyph outline. This may be used to simulate an oblique/italic style where no designed oblique/italic style is available.</summary>
