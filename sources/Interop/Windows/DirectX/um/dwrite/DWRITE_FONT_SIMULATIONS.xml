    <summary>
      <para>Specifies algorithmic style simulations to be applied to the font face. Bold and oblique simulations can be combined via bitwise OR operation.</para>

    <remarks>
      <para>Style simulations are not recommended for good typographic quality.</para>

  <member name="DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS.DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS_BOLD">
    <summary>
      <para>Indicates that algorithmic emboldening is applied to the font face.  <see cref="DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS_BOLD" /> increases weight by applying a widening algorithm to the glyph outline. This may  be used to simulate a bold weight where no designed bold weight is available.</para>

  <member name="DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS.DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS_OBLIQUE">
    <summary>
      <para>Indicates that algorithmic italicization is applied to the font face. <see cref="DWRITE_FONT_SIMULATIONS_OBLIQUE" /> applies obliquing (shear) to the glyph outline. This may be used to simulate an oblique/italic style where no designed oblique/italic style is available.</para>
