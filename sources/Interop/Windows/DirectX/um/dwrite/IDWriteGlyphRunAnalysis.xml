  <member name="IDWriteGlyphRunAnalysis.CreateAlphaTexture">
    <summary>Creates an alpha texture of the specified type for glyphs within a specified bounding rectangle.</summary>
    <param name="textureType">A value that specifies the type of texture requested. This can be <see cref="DWRITE_TEXTURE_BILEVEL_1x1" /> or <b>DWRITE_TEXTURE_CLEARTYPE_3x1</b>. If a bi-level texture is requested, the texture contains only bi-level glyphs. Otherwise, the texture contains only antialiased glyphs.</param>
    <param name="textureBounds">The bounding rectangle of the texture, which can be different than the bounding rectangle returned by <see cref="GetAlphaTextureBounds" />.</param>
    <param name="alphaValues">When this method returns, contains the array of alpha values from the texture. The buffer allocated for this array must be at least the size of <i>bufferSize</i>.</param>
    <param name="bufferSize">The size of the <i>alphaValues</i> array, in bytes. The minimum size depends on the dimensions of the rectangle and the type of texture requested.</param>
    <returns>If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.</returns>

  <member name="IDWriteGlyphRunAnalysis.GetAlphaBlendParams">
    <summary>Gets alpha blending properties required for ClearType blending.</summary>
    <param name="renderingParams">An object that specifies the ClearType level and enhanced contrast, gamma, pixel geometry, and rendering mode. In most cases, the values returned by the output parameters of this method are based on the properties of this object, unless a GDI-compatible rendering mode was specified.</param>
    <param name="blendGamma">When this method returns, contains the gamma value to use for gamma correction.</param>
    <param name="blendEnhancedContrast">When this method returns, contains the enhanced contrast value to be used for blending.</param>
    <param name="blendClearTypeLevel">When this method returns, contains the ClearType level used in the alpha blending.</param>
    <returns>If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.</returns>
  </member>
  <member name="IDWriteGlyphRunAnalysis.GetAlphaTextureBounds">
    <summary>Gets the bounding rectangle of the physical pixels affected by the glyph run.</summary>
    <param name="textureType">Specifies the type of texture requested. If a bi-level texture is requested, the bounding rectangle includes only bi-level glyphs. Otherwise, the bounding rectangle includes only antialiased glyphs.</param>
    <param name="textureBounds">When this method returns, contains the bounding rectangle of the physical pixels affected by the glyph run, or an empty rectangle if there are no glyphs of the specified texture type.</param>
    <returns>If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.</returns>
