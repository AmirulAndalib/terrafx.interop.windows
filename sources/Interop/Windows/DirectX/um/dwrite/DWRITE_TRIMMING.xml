      <para>A character code used as the delimiter that signals the beginning of the portion of text to be preserved.</para>
      <para>Text starting from the Nth occurrence of the delimiter (where N equals <i>delimiterCount</i>) counting backwards from the end of the text block will be preserved. For example, if the text is the path <code>C:\w\x\y\z\file.txt</code>, and <i>delimiter</i> is equal to '\', and <i>delimiterCount</i> is equal to 1, then the <code>file.txt</code> portion of the path would be preserved. Specifying a delimiterCount of 2 would preserve <code>z\file.txt</code>.</para>
