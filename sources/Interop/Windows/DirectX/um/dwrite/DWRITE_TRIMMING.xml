  <member name="DWRITE_TRIMMING.delimiter">
    <summary>A character code used as the delimiter that signals the beginning of the portion of text to be preserved. Text starting from the Nth occurrence of the delimiter (where N equals delimiterCount) counting backwards from the end of the text block will be preserved. For example, given the text is a path like c:\A\B\C\D\file.txt and delimiter equal to '' and delimiterCount equal to 1, the file.txt portion of the text would be preserved.<br />Specifying a delimiterCount of 2 would preserve D\file.txt.</summary>
