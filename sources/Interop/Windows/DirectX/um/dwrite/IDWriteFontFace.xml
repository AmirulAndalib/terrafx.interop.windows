    <summary>Obtains ideal (resolution-independent) glyph metrics in font design units.</summary>
    <param name="glyphIndices">An array of glyph indices for which to compute metrics. The array must contain at least as many elements as specified by <i>glyphCount</i>.</param>
    <param name="glyphCount">The number of elements in the <i>glyphIndices</i> array.</param>
    <param name="glyphMetrics">When this method returns, contains an array of DWRITE_GLYPH_METRICS structures. <i>glyphMetrics</i> must be initialized with an empty buffer that contains at least as many elements as <i>glyphCount</i>. The metrics returned by this function are in font design units.</param>
    <param name="isSideways">Indicates whether the font is being used in a sideways run. This can affect the glyph metrics if the font has oblique simulation because sideways oblique simulation differs from non-sideways oblique simulation</param>
    <returns>If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.</returns>

  <member name="IDWriteFontFace.GetFiles">
    <summary>Obtains the font files representing a font face.</summary>
    <param name="numberOfFiles">If <i>fontFiles</i> is <b>NULL</b>, receives the number of files representing the font face. Otherwise, the number of font files being requested should be passed. See the Remarks section below for more information.</param>
    <param name="fontFiles">When this method returns, contains a pointer to a user-provided array that stores pointers to font files representing the font face. This parameter can be <b>NULL</b> if the user wants only the number of files representing the font face. This API increments reference count of the font file pointers returned according to COM conventions, and the client should release them when finished.</param>

    <param name="tableData">When this method returns, contains the address of a pointer to the base of the table in memory.

    <param name="tableSize">When this method returns, contains a pointer to the size, in bytes, of the font table.</param>
    <param name="tableContext">When this method returns, the address of a pointer to the opaque context, which must be freed by calling <see cref="ReleaseFontTable" />.

It is possible for a <b>NULL</b><i>tableContext</i> to be returned, especially if the implementation performs direct memory mapping on the whole file. Nevertheless, always release it later, and do not use it as a test for function success.
