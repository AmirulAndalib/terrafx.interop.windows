  <member name="DWRITE_GLYPH_RUN">
    <summary>Contains the information needed by renderers to draw glyph runs. All coordinates are in device independent pixels (DIPs).</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DWRITE_GLYPH_RUN.fontFace">
    <summary>The physical font face object to draw with.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DWRITE_GLYPH_RUN.fontEmSize">
    <summary>The logical size of the font in DIPs (equals 1/96 inch), not points.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DWRITE_GLYPH_RUN.glyphCount">
    <summary>The number of glyphs in the glyph run.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DWRITE_GLYPH_RUN.glyphIndices">
    <summary>A pointer to an array of indices to render for the glyph run.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DWRITE_GLYPH_RUN.glyphAdvances">
    <summary>A pointer to an array containing glyph advance widths for the glyph run.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DWRITE_GLYPH_RUN.glyphOffsets">
    <summary>A pointer to an array containing glyph offsets for the glyph run.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DWRITE_GLYPH_RUN.isSideways">
    <summary>If true, specifies that glyphs are rotated 90 degrees to the left and vertical metrics are used. Vertical writing is achieved by specifying <b>isSideways</b> = true and rotating the entire run 90 degrees to the right via a rotate transform.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DWRITE_GLYPH_RUN.bidiLevel">
    <summary>The implicit resolved bidi level of the run. Odd levels indicate right-to-left languages like Hebrew and Arabic, while even levels indicate left-to-right languages like English and Japanese (when written horizontally). For right-to-left languages, the text origin is on the right, and text should be drawn to the left.</summary>
