  <member name="DWRITE_STRIKETHROUGH">
    <summary>Contains information regarding the size and placement of strikethroughs.All coordinates are in device independent pixels (DIPs).</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DWRITE_STRIKETHROUGH.width">
    <summary>A value that indicates the width of the strikethrough, measured parallel to the baseline.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DWRITE_STRIKETHROUGH.thickness">
    <summary>A value that indicates the thickness of the strikethrough, measured perpendicular to the baseline.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DWRITE_STRIKETHROUGH.offset">
    <summary>A value that indicates the offset of the strikethrough from the baseline. A positive offset represents a position below the baseline and a negative offset is above. Typically, the offset will be negative.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DWRITE_STRIKETHROUGH.readingDirection">
    <summary>Reading direction of the text associated with the strikethrough. This value is used to interpret whether the width value runs horizontally or vertically.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DWRITE_STRIKETHROUGH.flowDirection">
    <summary>Flow direction of the text associated with the strikethrough. This value is used to interpret whether the thickness value advances top to bottom, left to right, or right to left.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DWRITE_STRIKETHROUGH.localeName">
    <summary>An array of characters containing the locale of the text that is the strikethrough is being drawn over.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DWRITE_STRIKETHROUGH.measuringMode">
    <summary>The measuring mode can be useful to the renderer to determine how underlines are rendered, such as rounding the thickness to a whole pixel in GDI-compatible modes.</summary>
