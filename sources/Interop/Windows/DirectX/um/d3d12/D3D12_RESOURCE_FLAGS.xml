    <summary>
      <para>Allows a render target view to be created for the resource, as well as enables the resource to transition into the state of D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_RENDER_TARGET. Some adapter architectures allocate extra memory for textures with this flag to reduce the effective bandwidth during common rendering. This characteristic may not be beneficial for textures that are never rendered to, nor is it available for textures compressed with BC formats. Applications should avoid setting this flag when rendering will never occur.</para>

  <member name="D3D12_RESOURCE_FLAGS.D3D12_RESOURCE_FLAG_ALLOW_UNORDERED_ACCESS">
    <summary>
      <para>Allows an unordered access view to be created for the resource, as well as enables the resource to transition into the state of D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_UNORDERED_ACCESS. Some adapter architectures must resort to less efficient texture layouts in order to provide this functionality. If a texture is rarely used for unordered access, it may be worth having two textures around and copying between them. One texture would have this flag, while the other wouldn't. Applications should avoid setting this flag when unordered access operations will never occur.</para>

Some adapter architectures experience increased bandwidth for depth stencil textures when shader resource views are precluded. If a texture is rarely used for shader resource, it may be worth having two textures around and copying between them. One texture would have this flag and the other wouldn't.

    <summary>
      <para>Allows the resource to be used for cross-adapter data, as well as the same features enabled by ALLOW_SIMULTANEOUS_ACCESS. Cross adapter resources commonly preclude techniques that reduce effective texture bandwidth during usage, and some adapter architectures may require different caching behavior.

      <para>Allows a resource to be simultaneously accessed by multiple different queues, devices or processes (for example, allows a resource to be used with <see cref="ResourceBarrier" /> transitions performed in more than one command list

      <para>Simultaneous access allows multiple readers and one writer, as long as the writer doesn't concurrently modify the texels that other readers are accessing. Some adapter architectures cannot leverage techniques to reduce effective texture bandwidth during usage.</para>
      <para>However, applications should avoid setting this flag when multiple readers are not required during frequent, non-overlapping writes to textures. Use of this flag can compromise resource fences to perform waits, and prevents any compression being used with a resource.</para>
