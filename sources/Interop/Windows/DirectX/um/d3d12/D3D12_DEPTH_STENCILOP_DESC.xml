    <summary>
      <para>Describes stencil operations that can be performed based on the results of stencil test.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>All stencil operations are specified as a <see cref="D3D12_STENCIL_OP" />-typed value. Each stencil operation can be set differently based on the outcome of the stencil test, which is referred to as <b>StencilFunc</b>, in the stencil test portion of depth-stencil testing.</para>
      <para>Members of <see cref="D3D12_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC" /> have this structure for their data type.</para>
