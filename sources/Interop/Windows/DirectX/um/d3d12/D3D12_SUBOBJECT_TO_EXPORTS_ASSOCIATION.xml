    <summary>
      <para>Associates a subobject defined directly in a state object with shader exports.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>Depending on the flags specified in the optional <see cref="D3D12_STATE_OBJECT_CONFIG" /> subobject for opting into cross linkage, the exports being associated don’t necessarily have to be present in the current state object, or one that has been seen yet, to be resolved later, on raytracing pipeline state object (RTPSO) creation for example.</para>

    <summary>
      <para>Size of the <i>pExports</i> array.  If 0, this is being explicitly defined as a default association.  Another way to define a default association is to omit this subobject association for that subobject completely.</para>
