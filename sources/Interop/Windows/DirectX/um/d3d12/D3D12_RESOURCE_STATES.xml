    <summary>
      <para>Your application should transition to this state only for accessing a resource across different graphics engine types.</para>
      <para>Specifically, a resource must be in the COMMON state before being used on a COPY queue (when previously used on DIRECT/COMPUTE), and before being used on DIRECT/COMPUTE (when previously used on COPY). This restriction doesn't exist when accessing data between DIRECT and COMPUTE queues.</para>
      <para>The COMMON state can be used for all usages on a Copy queue using the implicit state transitions. For more info, in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/win32/direct3d12/user-mode-heap-synchronization">Multi-engine synchronization</a>, find "common".</para>
      <para>Additionally, textures must be in the COMMON state for CPU access to be legal, assuming the texture was created in a CPU-visible heap in the first place.</para>

      <para>The resource is used as a render target. A subresource must be in this state when it is rendered to, or when it is cleared with <see cref="ID3D12GraphicsCommandList.ClearRenderTargetView" />.</para>
      <para>This is a write-only state. To read from a render target as a shader resource, the resource must be in either <b>D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_NON_PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE</b> or <b>D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE</b>.</para>

      <para>The resource is used for unordered access. A subresource must be in this state when it is accessed by the GPU via an unordered access view. A subresource must also be in this state when it is cleared with <see cref="ID3D12GraphicsCommandList.ClearUnorderedAccessViewInt" /> or <see cref="ID3D12GraphicsCommandList.ClearUnorderedAccessViewFloat" />.

    <summary>
      <para>
        <b>D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_DEPTH_WRITE</b> is a state that is mutually exclusive with other states. You should use it for <see cref="ID3D12GraphicsCommandList.ClearDepthStencilView" /> when the flags (see <see cref="D3D12_CLEAR_FLAGS" />) indicate a given subresource should be cleared (otherwise the subresource state doesn't matter), or when using it in a writable depth stencil view (see <see cref="D3D12_DSV_FLAGS" />) when the PSO has depth write enabled (see <see cref="D3D12_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC" />).</para>

  <member name="D3D12_RESOURCE_STATES.D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_DEPTH_READ">
    <summary>
      <para>DEPTH_READ is a state that can be combined with other states. It should be used when the subresource is in a read-only depth stencil view, or when depth write of <see cref="D3D12_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC" /> is disabled. It can be combined with other read states (for example, <b>D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE</b>), such that the resource can be used for the depth or stencil test, and accessed by a shader within the same draw call. Using it when depth will be written by a draw call or clear command is invalid.</para>

      <para>The resource is used with a shader other than the pixel shader. A subresource must be in this state before being read by any stage (except for the pixel shader stage) via a shader resource view. You can still use the resource in a pixel shader with this flag as long as it also has the flag <b>D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE</b> set. This is a read-only state.</para>

  <member name="D3D12_RESOURCE_STATES.D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_GENERIC_READ">
    <summary>
      <para>D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_GENERIC_READ is a logically OR'd combination of other read-state bits. This is the required starting state for an upload heap. Your application should generally avoid transitioning to D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_GENERIC_READ when possible, since that can result in premature cache flushes, or resource layout changes (for example, compress/decompress), causing unnecessary pipeline stalls. You should instead transition resources only to the actually-used states.</para>
