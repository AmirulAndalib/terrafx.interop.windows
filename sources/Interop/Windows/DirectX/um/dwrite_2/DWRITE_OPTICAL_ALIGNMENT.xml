      <para>The optical margin alignment mode.</para>
      <para>By default, glyphs are aligned to the margin by the default origin and side-bearings of the glyph. If you specify <b>DWRITE_OPTICAL_ALIGNMENT_NO_SIDE_BEARINGS</b>, then the alignment uses the side bearings to offset the glyph from the aligned edge to ensure the ink of the glyphs are aligned.</para>
