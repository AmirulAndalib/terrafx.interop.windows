    <summary>A blob containing a null-terminated wide string, and using the native UTF-16 wide character encoding of Windows. <b>IDxcBlobUtf16</b> is a legacy alias for <b>IDxcBlobWide</b>. This interface is used to return output name strings in DXC. Other string output blobs (such as errors/warnings, preprocessed HLSL, or other text) are returned using encodings based on the <code>-encoding</code> option passed to the compiler. The methods of <b>IDxcBlobUtf16</b> guarantee null-terminated text, and native wide character encoding.</summary>
