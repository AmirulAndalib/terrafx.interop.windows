  <member name="ID3D11Device5.CreateFence">
    <summary>
      <para>Creates a fence object.</para>
      <para>This member function is equivalent to the Direct3D 12 <see cref="ID3D12Device.CreateFence" /> member function, and applies between Direct3D 11 and Direct3D 12 in interop scenarios.</para>
    </summary>
    <param name="InitialValue">The initial value for the fence.</param>
    <param name="Flags">A combination of <see cref="D3D11_FENCE_FLAG" />-typed values that are combined by using a bitwise OR operation. The resulting value specifies options for the fence.</param>
    <param name="ReturnedInterface">The globally unique identifier (<b>GUID</b>) for the fence interface (<see cref="ID3D11Fence" />). The <b>REFIID</b>, or <b>GUID</b>, of the interface to the fence can be obtained by using the __uuidof() macro. For example, __uuidof(ID3D11Fence) will get the <b>GUID</b> of the interface to a fence.</param>
    <param name="ppFence">A pointer to a memory block that receives a pointer to the <see cref="ID3D11Fence" /> interface that is used to access the fence.</param>
    <returns>Returns <b>S_OK</b> if successful; otherwise, returns one of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/direct3d11/d3d11-graphics-reference-returnvalues">Direct3D 11 Return Codes</a>.</returns>

  <member name="ID3D11Device5.OpenSharedFence">
    <summary>
      <para>Opens a handle for a shared fence by using HANDLE and REFIID.</para>
      <para>This member function is a limited version of the Direct3D 12 <see cref="ID3D12Device.OpenSharedHandle" /> member function, and applies between Direct3D 11 and Direct3D 12 in interop scenarios. Unlike <b>ID3D12Device.OpenSharedHandle</b> which operates on resources, heaps, and fences, the <b>ID3D11Device5.OpenSharedFence</b> function only operates on fences; in Direct3D 11, shared resources are opened with the <see cref="ID3D11Device.OpenSharedResource1" /> member function.</para>
    </summary>
    <param name="hFence">The handle that was returned by a call to <see cref="ID3D11Fence.CreateSharedHandle" /> or <see cref="ID3D12Device.CreateSharedHandle" />.</param>
    <param name="ReturnedInterface">The globally unique identifier (<b>GUID</b>) for the <see cref="ID3D11Fence" /> interface. The <b>REFIID</b>, or <b>GUID</b>, of the interface can be obtained by using the __uuidof() macro. For example, __uuidof(ID3D11Fence) will get the <b>GUID</b> of the interface to the fence.</param>
    <param name="ppFence">A pointer to a memory block that receives a pointer to the <see cref="ID3D11Fence" /> interface.</param>
    <returns>This method returns one of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/win32/direct3d11/d3d11-graphics-reference-returnvalues">Direct3D 11 Return Codes</a>.</returns>

  <member name="ID3D11Device5">
    <summary>
      <para>The device interface represents a virtual adapter; it is used to create resources. <b>ID3D11Device5</b> adds new methods to those in <see cref="ID3D11Device4" />.</para>
      <div>
        <b>Note</b>  This interface, introduced in the Windows 10 Creators Update, is the latest version of the <see cref="ID3D11Device" /> interface. Applications targetting Windows 10 Creators Update should use this interface instead of earlier versions.</div>
