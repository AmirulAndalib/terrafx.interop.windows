  <member name="X3DAUDIO_EMITTER">
    <summary>Defines a single-point or multiple-point 3D audio source that is used with an arbitrary number of sound channels.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="X3DAUDIO_EMITTER.pCone">
    <summary>Pointer to a sound cone. Used only with single-channel emitters for matrix, LPF (both direct and reverb paths), and reverb calculations. NULL specifies the emitter is omnidirectional.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="X3DAUDIO_EMITTER.OrientFront">
    <summary>Orientation of the front direction. This value must be orthonormal with <b>OrientTop</b>. <b>OrientFront</b> must be normalized when used. For single-channel emitters without cones <b>OrientFront</b> is only used for emitter angle calculations. For multi channel emitters or single-channel with cones <b>OrientFront</b> is used for matrix, LPF (both direct and reverb paths), and reverb calculations.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="X3DAUDIO_EMITTER.OrientTop">
    <summary>Orientation of the top direction. This value must be orthonormal with <b>OrientFront</b>. <b>OrientTop</b> is only used with multi-channel emitters for matrix calculations.</summary>

  <member name="X3DAUDIO_EMITTER.Position">
    <summary>Position in user-defined world units. This value does not affect <b>Velocity</b>.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="X3DAUDIO_EMITTER.Velocity">
    <summary>Velocity vector in user-defined world units/second. This value is used only for doppler calculations. It does not affect <b>Position</b>.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="X3DAUDIO_EMITTER.InnerRadius">
    <summary>Value to be used for the inner radius calculations. If <b>InnerRadius</b> is 0, then no inner radius is used, but <b>InnerRadiusAngle</b> may still be used. This value must be between 0.0f and MAX_FLT.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="X3DAUDIO_EMITTER.InnerRadiusAngle">
    <summary>Value to be used for the inner radius angle calculations. This value must be between 0.0f and X3DAUDIO_PI/4.0.</summary>

  <member name="X3DAUDIO_EMITTER.ChannelCount">
    <summary>Number of emitters defined by the <b>X3DAUDIO_EMITTER</b> structure. Must be greater than 0.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="X3DAUDIO_EMITTER.ChannelRadius">
    <summary>Distance from <b>Position</b> that channels will be placed if <b>ChannelCount</b> is greater than 1. <b>ChannelRadius</b> is only used with multi-channel emitters for matrix calculations. Must be greater than or equal to 0.0f.</summary>

  <member name="X3DAUDIO_EMITTER.pChannelAzimuths">
    <summary>Table of channel positions, expressed as an azimuth in radians along the channel radius with respect to the front orientation vector in the plane orthogonal to the top orientation vector. An azimuth of X3DAUDIO_2PI specifies a channel is a low-frequency effects (LFE) channel. LFE channels are positioned at the emitter base and are calculated with respect to <b>pLFECurve</b> only, never <b>pVolumeCurve</b>. <b>pChannelAzimuths</b> must have at least <b>ChannelCount</b> elements, but can be <b>NULL</b> if <b>ChannelCount</b> = 1. The table values must be within 0.0f to X3DAUDIO_2PI. <b>pChannelAzimuths</b> is used with multi-channel emitters for matrix calculations.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="X3DAUDIO_EMITTER.pVolumeCurve">
    <summary>
      <para>Volume-level distance curve, which is used only for matrix calculations. NULL specifies a specialized default curve that conforms to the inverse square law, such that when distance is between 0.0f and <b>CurveDistanceScaler</b> × 1.0f, no attenuation is applied. When distance is greater than <b>CurveDistanceScaler</b> × 1.0f, the amplification factor is (<b>CurveDistanceScaler</b> × 1.0f)/distance. At a distance of <b>CurveDistanceScaler</b> × 2.0f, the sound will be at half volume or -6 dB, at a distance of <b>CurveDistanceScaler</b> × 4.0f, the sound will be at one quarter volume or -12 dB, and so on.</para>
      <para>
        <b>pVolumeCurve</b> and pLFECurve are independent of each other. <b>pVolumeCurve</b> does not affect <b>LFE channel</b> volume.</para>

  <member name="X3DAUDIO_EMITTER.pLFECurve">
    <summary>LFE roll-off distance curve, or NULL to use default curve: [0.0f, <b>CurveDistanceScaler</b> ×1.0f], [<b>CurveDistanceScaler</b> ×1.0f, 0.0f]. A NULL value for <b>pLFECurve</b> specifies a default curve that conforms to the inverse square law with distances &lt;= <b>CurveDistanceScaler</b> clamped to no attenuation.<b>pVolumeCurve</b> and <b>pLFECurve</b> are independent of each other. <b>pLFECurve</b> does not affect non LFE channel volume.</summary>

    <summary>Curve distance scaler that is used to scale normalized distance curves to user-defined world units, and/or to exaggerate their effect. This does not affect any other calculations. The value must be within the range FLT_MIN to FLT_MAX. <b>CurveDistanceScaler</b> is only used for matrix, LPF (both direct and reverb paths), and reverb calculations.</summary>
