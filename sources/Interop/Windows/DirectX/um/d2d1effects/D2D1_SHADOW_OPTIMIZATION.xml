    <summary>The level of performance optimization for the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/Direct2D/drop-shadow">Shadow effect</a>.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D2D1_SHADOW_OPTIMIZATION.D2D1_SHADOW_OPTIMIZATION_SPEED">
    <summary>Applies internal optimizations such as pre-scaling at relatively small radii. Uses linear filtering.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D2D1_SHADOW_OPTIMIZATION.D2D1_SHADOW_OPTIMIZATION_BALANCED">
    <summary>Uses the same optimization thresholds as Speed mode, but uses trilinear filtering.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D2D1_SHADOW_OPTIMIZATION.D2D1_SHADOW_OPTIMIZATION_QUALITY">
    <summary>Only uses internal optimizations with large blur radii, where approximations are less likely to be visible. Uses trilinear filtering.</summary>
