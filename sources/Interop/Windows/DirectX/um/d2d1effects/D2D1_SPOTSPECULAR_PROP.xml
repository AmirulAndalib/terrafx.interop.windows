  <member name="D2D1_SPOTSPECULAR_PROP.D2D1_SPOTSPECULAR_PROP_LIGHT_POSITION">
    <summary>
      <para>The light position of the point light source. The property is a <see cref="D2D1_VECTOR_3F" /> defined as (x, y, z). The units are in device-independent pixels (DIPs) and are unbounded.</para>
      <para>The type is <see cref="D2D1_VECTOR_3F" />.</para>
      <para>The default value is {0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f}.</para>

  <member name="D2D1_SPOTSPECULAR_PROP.D2D1_SPOTSPECULAR_PROP_POINTS_AT">
    <summary>
      <para>Where the spot light is focused. The property is exposed as a <see cref="D2D1_VECTOR_3F" /> with – (x, y, z). The units are in DIPs and the values are unbounded.</para>
      <para>The type is <see cref="D2D1_VECTOR_3F" />.</para>

  <member name="D2D1_SPOTSPECULAR_PROP.D2D1_SPOTSPECULAR_PROP_FOCUS">
    <summary>
      <para>The focus of the spot light. This property is unitless and is defined between 0 and 200.</para>
      <para>The type is FLOAT.</para>
      <para>The default value is 1.0f.</para>

  <member name="D2D1_SPOTSPECULAR_PROP.D2D1_SPOTSPECULAR_PROP_LIMITING_CONE_ANGLE">
    <summary>
      <para>The cone angle that restricts the region where the light is projected. No light is projected outside the cone. The limiting cone angle is the angle between the spot light axis (the axis between the LightPosition and PointsAt properties) and the spot light cone. This property is defined in degrees and must be between 0 to 90 degrees.</para>
      <para>The type is FLOAT.</para>
      <para>The default value is 90.0f.</para>

  <member name="D2D1_SPOTSPECULAR_PROP.D2D1_SPOTSPECULAR_PROP_SPECULAR_EXPONENT">
    <summary>
      <para>The exponent for the specular term in the Phong lighting equation. A larger value corresponds to a more reflective surface. This value is unitless and must be between 1.0 and 128.</para>
      <para>The type is FLOAT.</para>
      <para>The default value is 1.0f.</para>

  <member name="D2D1_SPOTSPECULAR_PROP.D2D1_SPOTSPECULAR_PROP_SPECULAR_CONSTANT">
    <summary>
      <para>The ratio of specular reflection to the incoming light. The value is unitless and must be between 0 and 10,000.</para>
      <para>The type is FLOAT.</para>
      <para>The default value is 1.0f.</para>

  <member name="D2D1_SPOTSPECULAR_PROP.D2D1_SPOTSPECULAR_PROP_SURFACE_SCALE">
    <summary>
      <para>The scale factor in the Z direction for generating a height map. The value is unitless and must be between 0 and 10,000.</para>
      <para>The type is FLOAT.</para>
      <para>The default value is 1.0f.</para>

  <member name="D2D1_SPOTSPECULAR_PROP.D2D1_SPOTSPECULAR_PROP_COLOR">
    <summary>
      <para>The color of the incoming light. This property is exposed as a Vector 3 – (R, G, B) and used to compute LR, LG, LB.</para>
      <para>The type is <see cref="D2D1_VECTOR_3F" />.</para>
      <para>The default value is {1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f}.</para>

  <member name="D2D1_SPOTSPECULAR_PROP.D2D1_SPOTSPECULAR_PROP_KERNEL_UNIT_LENGTH">
    <summary>
      <para>The size of an element in the Sobel kernel used to generate the surface normal in the X and Y direction. This property maps to the dx and dy values in the Sobel gradient. This property is a D2D1_VECTOR_2F (Kernel Unit Length X, Kernel Unit Length Y) and is defined in (DIPs/Kernel Unit). The effect uses bilinear interpolation to scale the bitmap to match size of kernel elements.</para>
      <para>The type is <see cref="D2D1_VECTOR_2F" />.</para>

  <member name="D2D1_SPOTSPECULAR_PROP.D2D1_SPOTSPECULAR_PROP_SCALE_MODE">
    <summary>
      <para>The interpolation mode the effect uses to scale the image to the corresponding kernel unit length. There are six scale modes that range in quality and speed.</para>
      <para>The type is <see cref="D2D1_SPOTSPECULAR_SCALE_MODE" />.</para>
