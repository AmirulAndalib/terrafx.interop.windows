    <summary>
      <para>Families are grouped by the typographic family name preferred by the font author. The family can contain as many faces as the font author wants. This corresponds to <see cref="DWRITE_FONT_PROPERTY_ID_TYPOGRAPHIC_FAMILY_NAME" />.</para>

  <member name="DWRITE_FONT_FAMILY_MODEL.DWRITE_FONT_FAMILY_MODEL_WEIGHT_STRETCH_STYLE">
    <summary>
      <para>Families are grouped by the weight-stretch-style family name, where all faces that differ only by those three axes are grouped into the same family, but any other axes go into a distinct family. For example, the Sitka family with six different optical sizes yields six separate families (Sitka Caption, Display, Text, Subheading, Heading, Banner...). This corresponds to <see cref="DWRITE_FONT_PROPERTY_ID_WEIGHT_STRETCH_STYLE_FAMILY_NAME" />.</para>
