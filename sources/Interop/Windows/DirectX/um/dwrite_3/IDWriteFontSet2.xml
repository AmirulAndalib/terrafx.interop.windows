  <member name="IDWriteFontSet2.GetExpirationEvent">
    <summary>
      <para>Retrieves the expiration event for the font set, if any. The expiration event is set on a system font set object if it is out of date due to fonts being installed, uninstalled, or updated. You should handle the event by getting a new system font set.</para>
    </summary>
    <returns>
      <para>Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types">HANDLE</a></b></para>
      <para>An event handle, if called on the system font set, or <code>nullptr</code> if called on a custom font set.</para>
    </returns>
    <remarks>
      <para>You mustn't call <b>CloseHandle</b> on the returned event handle. The handle is owned by the font set object, and it remains valid as long as you hold a reference to the font set. You can wait on the returned event, or use <see cref="RegisterWaitForSingleObject" /> to request a callback when the event is set.</para>
