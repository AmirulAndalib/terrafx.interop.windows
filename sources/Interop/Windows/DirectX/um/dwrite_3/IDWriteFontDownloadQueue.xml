  <member name="IDWriteFontDownloadQueue.BeginDownload">
    <summary>Begins an asynchronous download operation. The download operation executes<br />in the background until it completes or is cancelled by a <see cref="CancelDownload" /> call.</summary>
    <param name="context">Optional context object that is passed back to the<br />download notification handler's DownloadCompleted method. If the context object<br />implements IDWriteFontDownloadListener, its DownloadCompleted will be called<br />when done.</param>
    <returns>Returns S_OK if a download was successfully begun, S_FALSE if the queue was empty, or a standard HRESULT error code.</returns>
