  <member name="DWRITE_LINE_SPACING.leadingBefore">
    <summary>Proportion of the entire leading distributed before the line. The allowed value is between 0 and 1.0. The remaining leading is distributed after the line. It is ignored for the default and uniform line spacing methods. The leading that is available to distribute before or after the line depends on the values of the height and baseline parameters.</summary>
