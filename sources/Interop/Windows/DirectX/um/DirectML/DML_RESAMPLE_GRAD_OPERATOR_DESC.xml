    <summary>
      <para>Computes backpropagation gradients for Resample (see <see cref="DML_RESAMPLE1_OPERATOR_DESC" />).</para>
      <para>
        <b>DML_RESAMPLE1_OPERATOR_DESC</b> rescales arbitrary dimensions of the input tensor using either nearest-neighbor sampling or bilinear interpolation. Given an <i>InputGradientTensor</i> with the same sizes as the <i>output</i> of an equivalent <b>DML_RESAMPLE1_OPERATOR_DESC</b>, this operator produces an <i>OutputGradientTensor</i> with the same sizes as the <i>input</i> of the <b>DML_RESAMPLE1_OPERATOR_DESC</b>.</para>
      <para>As an example, consider a <b>DML_RESAMPLE1_OPERATOR_DESC</b> that performs a nearest-neighbor scaling of 1.5x in the width, and 0.5x in the height.</para>
      <code>InputTensor OutputTensor [[1, 2], Resample [1, 1, 2] [3, 4]] --&gt;</code>
      <para>Notice how the 0th element of the input tensor (with value 1) contributes to two elements in the output, the 1st element (with value 2) contributes to one element in the output, and the 2nd and 3rd elements (with values 3 and 4) contribute to no elements of the output.</para>
      <para>The corresponding <b>DML_RESAMPLE_GRAD_OPERATOR_DESC</b> would perform the following.</para>
      <code>InputGradientTensor OutputGradientTensor [4, 5, 6] ResampleGrad [[9, 6], --&gt; [0, 0]]</code>
      <para>Notice that the values in the <i>OutputGradientTensor</i> represent the weighted contributions of that element to the <i>OutputTensor</i> during the original <b>DML_RESAMPLE1_OPERATOR_DESC</b> operator.</para>
