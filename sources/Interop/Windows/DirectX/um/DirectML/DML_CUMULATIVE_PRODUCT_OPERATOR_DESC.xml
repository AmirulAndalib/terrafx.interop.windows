    <summary>
      <para>A tensor containing the input data. This is typically the same tensor that was provided as the <i>InputTensor</i> to <see cref="DML_BATCH_NORMALIZATION_OPERATOR_DESC" /> in the forward pass.</para>

    <summary>The output tensor to write the resulting cumulative products to. This tensor must have the same sizes and data type as <i>InputTensor</i>.</summary>

    <summary>The index of the dimension to multiply elements over. This value must be less than the <i>DimensionCount</i> of the <i>InputTensor</i>.</summary>

    <summary>One of the values of the <see cref="DML_AXIS_DIRECTION" /> enumeration. If set to <b>DML_AXIS_DIRECTION_INCREASING</b>, then the product occurs by traversing the tensor along the specified axis by ascending element index. If set to <b>DML_AXIS_DIRECTION_DECREASING</b>, the reverse is true and the product occurs by traversing elements by descending index.</summary>

    <summary>If <b>TRUE</b>, then the value of the current element is excluded when writing the running tally to the output tensor. If <b>FALSE</b>, then the value of the current element is included in the running tally.</summary>
