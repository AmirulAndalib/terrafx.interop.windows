  <member name="DML_FEATURE_LEVEL">
    <summary>
      <para>Defines constants that specify a DirectML <i>feature level</i>. A feature level defines a broad umbrella of functionality supported by DirectML. In using DirectML, you can target specific feature levels, depending on a tradeoff between the level of functionality needed versus the version of DirectML required.</para>
      <para>Feature levels in DirectML are strict supersets of one another. This means that every feature level necessarily supports everything that exists in every feature level below (earlier than) it.</para>
      <para>For example, <code>DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_2_0</code> supports everything that <code>DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_1_0</code> does in addition to some new functionality. Similarly, <code>DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_2_1</code> supports everything that <code>DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_2_0</code> and <code>DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_1_0</code> do plus some additional features.</para>
      <para>You can specify a <i>minimum feature level</i> when creating the DirectML device using <see cref="DMLCreateDevice1" />. This has the effect of causing device creation to fail if the underlying DirectML implementation is unable to satisfy the requested feature level. This is useful, for example, if using the system version of DirectML and a user runs your application on an older version of Windows 10.</para>
      <para>A DirectML device might support feature levels above the minimum feature level requested through <b>DMLCreateDevice1</b>. You can query the device for its supported feature levels using <see cref="IDMLDevice.CheckFeatureSupport" />.</para>
      <para>For a list of new capabilities included in each feature level, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/ai/directml/dml-feature-level-history">DirectML feature level history</a>.</para>

    <remarks>
      <para>The <b>DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_4_1</b> constant was introduced in <code>DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_4_1</code>. <b>DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_4_1</b> specifies feature level 4_1.</para>
