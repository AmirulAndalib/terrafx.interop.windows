    <summary>
      <para>Used to query a DirectML device for its support for one or more feature levels. See <see cref="IDMLDevice.CheckFeatureSupport" />. The feature constant is <b>DML_FEATURE_FEATURE_LEVELS</b>, and the support data type is <see cref="DML_FEATURE_DATA_FEATURE_LEVELS" />.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>This query is useful in combination with the <i>minimumFeatureLevel</i> parameter of <see cref="DMLCreateDevice1" />. By supplying a minimum feature level to <b>DMLCreateDevice1</b>, you can be guaranteed a <i>lower</i> bound to the underlying DirectML device's feature level support.</para>
      <para>Using this query, you can then also retrieve an <i>upper</i> bound for the feature levels supported by this DirectML device. This information can then be used to achieve graceful fallbacks in cases where particular features are unavailable.</para>

      <para>An array of feature levels to query support for. When <see cref="IDMLDevice.CheckFeatureSupport" /> returns, the <see cref="DML_FEATURE_DATA_FEATURE_LEVELS" /> struct contains the highest feature level in this array that is supported by the device.</para>
