    <summary>The output tensor to write the resulting cumulative summations to. This tensor must have the same sizes and data type as the <i>InputTensor</i>.</summary>

    <summary>The index of the dimension to sum elements over. This value must be less than the <i>DimensionCount</i> of the <i>InputTensor</i>.</summary>

  <member name="DML_CUMULATIVE_SUMMATION_OPERATOR_DESC.AxisDirection">
    <summary>One of the values of the <see cref="DML_AXIS_DIRECTION" /> enumeration. If set to <b>DML_AXIS_DIRECTION_INCREASING</b>, then the summation occurs by traversing the tensor along the specified axis by ascending element index. If set to <b>DML_AXIS_DIRECTION_DECREASING</b>, the reverse is true, and the summation occurs by traversing elements by descending index.</summary>

  <member name="DML_CUMULATIVE_SUMMATION_OPERATOR_DESC.HasExclusiveSum">
    <summary>If <b>TRUE</b>, then the value of the current element is excluded when writing the running tally to the output tensor. If <b>FALSE</b>, then the value of the current element is included in the running tally.</summary>
