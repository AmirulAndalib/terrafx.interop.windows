    <summary>
      <para>Type: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types">UINT</a></para>
      <para>The minimum size, in descriptors, of the binding table required for a particular dispatchable object (an operator initializer, or a compiled operator).</para>

    <summary>
      <para>Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT64</a></b></para>
      <para>The minimum size in bytes of the temporary resource that must be bound to the binding table for a particular dispatchable
object. A value of zero means that a temporary resource is not required.</para>

  <member name="DML_BINDING_PROPERTIES.PersistentResourceSize">
    <summary>
      <para>Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">UINT64</a></b></para>
      <para>The minimum size in bytes of the persistent resource that must be bound to the binding table for a particular
dispatchable object. Persistent resources must be supplied during initialization of a compiled operator (where it
is bound as an output of the operator initializer) as well as during execution. A value of zero means that a
persistent resource is not required. Only compiled operators have persistent resources—operator initializers
always return a value of 0 for this member.</para>
