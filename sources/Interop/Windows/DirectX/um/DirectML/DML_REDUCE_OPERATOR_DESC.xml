    <summary>
      <para>Outputs the reduction of elements (sum, product, minimum, and so on) within one or more dimensions of the input tensor.</para>
      <para>Each output element is the result of applying a reduction function on a subset of the input tensor. A reduction function, such as <i>sum</i>, maps <code>N</code> input elements to a single output element. The input elements involved in each reduction are determined by the provided input axes: <code>N</code> is equal to the product of the sizes of the reduced axes. If all input axes are specified, then the operator performs a reduction on the entire input tensor and produces a single output element.</para>
