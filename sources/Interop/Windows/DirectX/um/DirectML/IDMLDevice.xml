    <summary>
      <para>Compiles an operator into an object that can be dispatched to the GPU.</para>
      <para>A compiled operator represents the efficient, baked form of an operator suitable for execution on the GPU.
A compiled operator holds state (such as shaders and other objects) required for execution. Because a compiled operator
implements the <see cref="IDMLPageable" /> interface, you're able to evict one from GPU memory if you wish. See
<see cref="IDMLDevice.Evict" /> and <see cref="IDMLDevice.MakeResident" /> for more info.</para>

  <member name="IDMLDevice.CreateBindingTable">
    <summary>
      <para>Creates a binding table, which is an object that can be used to bind resources (such as tensors) to the pipeline.</para>
      <para>The binding table wraps a range of an application-managed descriptor heap using the provided descriptor handles
and count.  Binding tables are used by DirectML to manage the binding of resources by writing descriptors into
the descriptor heap at the offset specified by the <b>CPUDescriptorHandle</b>, and binding those descriptors to the
pipeline using the descriptors at the offset specified by the <b>GPUDescriptorHandle</b>. The order in which
DirectML writes descriptors into the heap is unspecified, so your application must take care not to overwrite the
descriptors wrapped by the binding table.</para>
      <para>The supplied CPU and GPU descriptor handles may come from different heaps, however it is then your
application's responsibility to ensure that the entire descriptor range referred to by the CPU descriptor
handle is copied into the range referred to by the GPU descriptor handle prior to execution using this binding
table.</para>
      <para>The descriptor heap from which the handles are supplied must have type <see cref="D3D12_DESCRIPTOR_HEAP_TYPE_CBV_SRV_UAV" />.
Additionally, the heap referred to by the <b>GPUDescriptorHandle</b> must be a shader-visible descriptor heap.</para>
      <para>You must not delete the heap referred to by the GPU descriptor handle until all work referencing it has
completed execution on the GPU. You may, however, reset or release the binding table itself as soon as the
dispatch has been recorded into the command list. Similar to the relationship between <see cref="ID3D12CommandList" /> and
<see cref="ID3D12CommandAllocator" />, the <see cref="IDMLBindingTable" /> doesn't own the underlying memory referenced by the descriptor
handles. Rather, the <see cref="ID3D12DescriptorHeap" /> does. Therefore, you're permitted to reset or release a DirectML binding table before work using the binding table has completed execution on the GPU.</para>

  <member name="IDMLDevice.CreateCommandRecorder">
    <summary>
      <para>Creates a DirectML command recorder.</para>
      <para>A command recorder allows your application to record the initialization and execution of compiled operators into
existing Direct3D 12 command lists. The command recorder is a stateless object: it does not own command lists or
operators, nor does it execute any GPU work. Instead, it merely records the commands necessary for
dispatching initialization or execution into an application-supplied command list. Your application is then
responsible for submitting the execution of that command list to the Direct3D 12 command queue.</para>

  <member name="IDMLDevice.CreateOperatorInitializer">
    <summary>
      <para>Creates an object that can be used to initialize compiled operators.</para>
      <para>Once compiled, an operator must be
initialized exactly once on the GPU before it can be executed. The operator initializer holds the state
necessary for initialization of one or more target compiled operators.</para>
      <para>Once instantiated, dispatch of the operator initializer can be recorded in a command list via
<see cref="IDMLCommandRecorder.RecordDispatch" />. After execution completes on the GPU, all compiled operators that are
targets of the initializer enter the initialized state.</para>
      <para>An operator initializer can be reused to initialize different sets of compiled operators. See
<see cref="IDMLOperatorInitializer.Reset" /> for more info.</para>
      <para>An operator initializer can be created with no target operators. Executing such an initializer is a no-op.
Creating an operator initializer with no target operators may be useful if you wish to create an initializer
up-front, but don't yet know which operators it will be used to initialize. <see cref="IDMLOperatorInitializer.Reset" /> can be used to reset which
operators to target.</para>
