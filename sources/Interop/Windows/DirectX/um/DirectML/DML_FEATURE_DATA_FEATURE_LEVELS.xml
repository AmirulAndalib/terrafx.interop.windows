      <para>Type: <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/win32/direct3d12/ne-directml-dml_feature_level">DML_FEATURE_LEVEL</a></b></para>
      <para>The highest feature level supplied in the query structure's <i>RequestedFeatureLevels</i> (see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/win32/direct3d12/ns-directml-dml_feature_data_feature_levels">DML_FEATURE_DATA_FEATURE_LEVELS</a>) that is supported by this device.</para>
      <blockquote>
        <para>[!NOTE]
Because this feature query only ever returns one of the values supplied in <i>RequestedFeatureLevels</i>, it's possible that the device supports an even higher feature level than the one returned by this query.</para>
      </blockquote>
      <para>For example, DirectML version <code>1.4.0</code> supports a feature level of <code>DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_3_0</code>. If the <i>RequestedFeatureLevels</i> array contained only <code>DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_1_0</code> and <code>DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_2_0</code>, then this query would return <code>DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_2_0</code>, which is lower than the true feature level (3_0) supported by the device.</para>
