    <summary>
      <para>Type: <b>const <see cref="DML_TENSOR_DESC" />*</b></para>
      <para>A tensor containing a value for each subsequence to be reversed, denoting the length in elements of that subsequence. Only the elements within the length of the subsequence are reversed; the remaining elements along that axis are copied to the output unchanged.</para>
      <para>This tensor must have dimension count and sizes equal to the <i>InputTensor</i>, <i>except</i> for the dimension specified by the <i>Axis</i> parameter. The size of the <i>Axis</i> dimension must be 1. For example if the <i>InputTensor</i> has sizes of <code>{2,3,4,5}</code>, and <i>Axis</i> is 1, then the sizes of the <i>SequenceLengthsTensor</i> must be <code>{2,1,4,5}</code>.</para>
      <para>If the length of a subsequence exceeds the maximum number of elements along that axis, then this operator behaves as if the value were clamped to the maximum.</para>
