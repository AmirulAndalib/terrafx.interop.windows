  <member name="DML_CONVOLUTION_MODE">
    <summary>Defines constants that specify a mode for the DirectML convolution operator (as described by the <see cref="DML_CONVOLUTION_OPERATOR_DESC" /> structure).</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DML_CONVOLUTION_MODE.DML_CONVOLUTION_MODE_CONVOLUTION">
    <summary>Specifies the convolution mode. When used along with <see cref="DML_CONVOLUTION_DIRECTION_FORWARD" />, this flips the filter along the height and width axes.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DML_CONVOLUTION_MODE.DML_CONVOLUTION_MODE_CROSS_CORRELATION">
    <summary>Specifies the cross-correlation mode. If in doubt, use this mode—it is appropriate for the vast majority of machine learning (ML) model inference. When used along with <see cref="DML_CONVOLUTION_DIRECTION_BACKWARD" />, this flips the filter along the height and width axes.</summary>
