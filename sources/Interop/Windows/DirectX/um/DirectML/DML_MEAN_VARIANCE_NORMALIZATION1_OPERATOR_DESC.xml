    <summary>
      <para>Performs a mean variance normalization function on the input tensor. This operator will calculate the mean and variance of the input tensor to perform normalization. This operator performs the following computation.</para>
      <code>Output = FusedActivation(Scale * ((Input - Mean) / sqrt(Variance + Epsilon)) + Bias).</code>
