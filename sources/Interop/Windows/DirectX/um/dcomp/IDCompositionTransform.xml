    <summary>
      <para>Represents a 2D transformation that can be used to modify the coordinate space of a visual subtree.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>The <b>IDCompositionTransform</b> interface is an abstract interface that represents a 2D affine transformation. Transformations affect the entire visual subtree that is rooted at the visual that the transform is associated with. A transform object can be associated with multiple visuals. When a transform object is modified, all affected visuals are recomposed to reflect the change.</para>
      <para>Transforms operate by modifying the coordinate system for all rendering operations on a visual. For example, ordinarily a bitmap that is associated with a visual draws at position (0,0) and extends the full width and height of the bitmap. If a translation transform is applied, the bitmap draws at a position that is offset by that transform. If a scale transform is applied, the extent covered by the bitmap is affected by the scale transform. More than one transform can be simultaneously applied to a visual by using the <see cref="IDCompositionDevice.CreateTransformGroup" /> interface.</para>
