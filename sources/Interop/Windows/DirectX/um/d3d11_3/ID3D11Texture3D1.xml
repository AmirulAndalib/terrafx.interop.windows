    <summary>
      <para>A 3D texture interface represents texel data, which is structured memory.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>To create an empty Texture3D resource, call <see cref="ID3D11Device3.CreateTexture3D1" />. For info about how to create a 2D texture, which is similar to creating a 3D texture, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/direct3d11/overviews-direct3d-11-resources-textures-create">How to: Create a Texture</a>.</para>
      <para>Textures can't be bound directly to the pipeline; instead, a view must be created and bound. Using a view, texture data can be interpreted at run time within certain restrictions. To use the texture as a render-target or depth-stencil resource, call <see cref="ID3D11Device3.CreateRenderTargetView1" />, and <see cref="ID3D11Device.CreateDepthStencilView" />, respectively. To use the texture as an input to a shader, call <see cref="ID3D11Device3.CreateShaderResourceView1" />.</para>
