    <summary>
      <para>Represents a query object for querying information from the graphics processing unit (GPU).</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>A query can be created with <see cref="ID3D11Device3.CreateQuery1" />.</para>
      <para>Query data is typically gathered by issuing an <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext.Begin" /> command, issuing some graphics commands, issuing an <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext.End" /> command, and then calling <see cref="ID3D11DeviceContext.GetData" /> to get data about what happened in between the Begin and End calls. The data returned by <b>GetData</b> will be different depending on the type of query.</para>
      <para>There are, however, some queries that do not require calls to <see cref="Begin" />. For a list of possible queries see <see cref="D3D11_QUERY" />.</para>
      <para>When using a query that does not require a call to <see cref="Begin" />, it still requires a call to <see cref="End" />. The call to <b>End</b> causes the data returned by <see cref="GetData" /> to be accurate up until the last call to <b>End</b>.</para>
