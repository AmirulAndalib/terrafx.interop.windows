    <remarks>
      <para>This method overrides the default behavior of GPU-based validation so it must be called before creating the Direct3D 12 device. These settings can't be changed or cancelled after the device is created. If you want to change the behavior of GPU-based validation at a later time, the device must be destroyed and recreated with different parameters.</para>
