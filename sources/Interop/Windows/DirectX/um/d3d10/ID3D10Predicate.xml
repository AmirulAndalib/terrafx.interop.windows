    <summary>
      <para>A predicate interface determines whether geometry should be processed depending on the results of a previous draw call.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>A predicate can be created with <see cref="ID3D10Device.CreatePredicate" />, and used with <see cref="ID3D10Device.SetPredication" />.</para>
      <para>There are two types of predicates in Direct3D 10: stream-output-overflow predicates and occlusion predicates. Stream-output-overflow predicates will cause any geometry residing in stream-output buffers that were overflowed to not be processed. Occlusion predicates will cause any geometry that did not have a single sample pass the depth/stencil tests to not be processed.</para>
      <para>For an example of occlusion-predicated rendering, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee416402(v=vs.85).aspx">Draw Predicated Sample</a>.</para>
