    <summary>If this is <b>TRUE</b>, something occurred in between the query's <see cref="ID3D10Asynchronous.Begin" /> and <see cref="ID3D10Asynchronous.End" /> calls that caused the timestamp counter to become discontinuous or disjoint, such as unplugging the AC chord on a laptop, overheating, or throttling up/down due to laptop savings events. The timestamp returned by <see cref="ID3D10Asynchronous.GetData" /> for a timestamp query is only reliable if Disjoint is <b>FALSE</b>.</summary>
