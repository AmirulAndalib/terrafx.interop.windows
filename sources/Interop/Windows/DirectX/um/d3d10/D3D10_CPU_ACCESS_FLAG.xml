      <para>Specifies the types of CPU access allowed for a resource.</para>

      <para>This enumeration is used in <see cref="D3D10_BUFFER_DESC" />, <see cref="D3D10_TEXTURE1D_DESC" />, <see cref="D3D10_TEXTURE2D_DESC" />, <see cref="D3D10_TEXTURE3D_DESC" />, and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/direct3d10/d3dx10-image-load-info">D3DX10_IMAGE_LOAD_INFO</a>. See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/direct3d10/d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-resources-creating">Creating Buffer Resources (Direct3D 10)</a> for more details.</para>
      <para>Applications can combine one or more of these flags with a bitwise OR. When possible, create resources with no CPU access flags, as this enables better resource optimization.</para>

      <para>The resource is to be <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/direct3d10/d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-resources-mapping">mappable</a> so that the CPU can change its contents.
