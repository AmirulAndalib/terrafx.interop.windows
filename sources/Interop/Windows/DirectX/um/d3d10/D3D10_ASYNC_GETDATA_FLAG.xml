    <summary>Do not flush the command buffer. This can potentially cause an infinite loop if GetData is continually called until it returns S_OK as there may still be commands in the command buffer that need to be processed in order for GetData to return S_OK. Since the commands in the command buffer are not flushed they will not be processed and therefore GetData will never return S_OK.</summary>
