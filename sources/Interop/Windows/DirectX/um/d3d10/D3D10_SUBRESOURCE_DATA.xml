    <summary>
      <para>Specifies data for initializing a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//windows/desktop/direct3d10/d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-resources-types">subresource</a>.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>This structure is used in calls to create buffers (<see cref="ID3D10Device.CreateBuffer" />) and textures (<see cref="ID3D10Device.CreateTexture1D" />,
<see cref="ID3D10Device.CreateTexture2D" />, and <see cref="ID3D10Device.CreateTexture3D" />).
If the resource being created does not require a system-memory pitch or a system-memory-pitch slice, then you are free to use those members to
pass size information which may help you when debugging a problem creating a resource.</para>
      <para>Note that an application should not rely on <b>SysMemPitch</b> being exactly equal to the number of texels in a line times the size of a texel.
In some cases <b>SysMemPitch</b> will include padding to skip past additional data in a line.  This could be padding for alignment or
the texture could be a subsection of a larger texture.  For example the D3D10_SUBRESOURCE_DATA structure could represent a 32 by 32 subsection of a 128 by 128 texture.
The value for <b>SysMemSlicePitch</b> will reflect any padding included in <b>SysMemPitch</b>.</para>

System-memory pitch is used only for 2D and 3D texture data as it is has no meaning for the other resource types.</para>
