  <member name="DWRITE_JUSTIFICATION_OPPORTUNITY.expansionMinimum">
    <summary>
      <para>Minimum amount of expansion to apply to the side of the glyph. This might vary from zero to infinity, typically being zero except for kashida.</para>

  <member name="DWRITE_JUSTIFICATION_OPPORTUNITY.expansionMaximum">
    <summary>
      <para>Maximum amount of expansion to apply to the side of the glyph. This might vary from zero to infinity, being zero for fixed-size characters and connected scripts, and non-zero for discrete scripts, and non-zero for cursive scripts at expansion points.</para>

  <member name="DWRITE_JUSTIFICATION_OPPORTUNITY.compressionMaximum">
    <summary>
      <para>Maximum amount of compression to apply to the side of the glyph. This might vary from zero up to the glyph cluster size.</para>

    <summary>
      <para>Priority of this expansion point. Larger priorities are applied later, while priority zero does nothing.</para>

  <member name="DWRITE_JUSTIFICATION_OPPORTUNITY.applyToLeadingEdge">
    <summary>
      <para>Apply expansion and compression to the leading edge of the glyph. This bit is <b>FALSE</b> (0) for connected scripts, fixed-size characters, and diacritics. It is generally <b>FALSE</b> within a multi-glyph cluster, unless the script allows expansion of glyphs within a cluster, like Thai.</para>

  <member name="DWRITE_JUSTIFICATION_OPPORTUNITY.applyToTrailingEdge">
    <summary>
      <para>Apply expansion and compression to the trailing edge of the glyph. This bit is <b>FALSE</b> (0) for connected scripts, fixed-size characters, and diacritics. It is generally <b>FALSE</b> within a multi-glyph cluster, unless the script allows expansion of glyphs within a cluster, like Thai.</para>
