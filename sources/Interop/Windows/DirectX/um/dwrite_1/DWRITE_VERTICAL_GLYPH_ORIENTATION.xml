    <summary>The <b>DWRITE_VERTICAL_GLYPH_ORIENTATION</b> enumeration contains values that specify the desired kind of glyph orientation for the text.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DWRITE_VERTICAL_GLYPH_ORIENTATION.DWRITE_VERTICAL_GLYPH_ORIENTATION_DEFAULT">
    <summary>The default glyph orientation. In vertical layout, naturally horizontal scripts (Latin, Thai, Arabic, Devanagari) rotate 90 degrees clockwise, while ideographic scripts (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) remain upright, 0 degrees.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="DWRITE_VERTICAL_GLYPH_ORIENTATION.DWRITE_VERTICAL_GLYPH_ORIENTATION_STACKED">
    <summary>Stacked glyph orientation. Ideographic scripts and scripts that permit stacking (Latin, Hebrew) are stacked in vertical reading layout. Connected scripts (Arabic, Syriac, 'Phags-pa, Ogham), which would otherwise look broken if glyphs were kept at 0 degrees, remain connected and rotate.</summary>
