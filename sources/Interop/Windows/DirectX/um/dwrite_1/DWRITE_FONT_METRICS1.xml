  <member name="DWRITE_FONT_METRICS1.subscriptPositionX">

      <para>Horizontal position of the subscript relative to the baseline origin. This is typically negative (to the left) in italic and oblique fonts, and zero in regular fonts.</para>

    <summary>
      <para>Horizontal size of the subscript em box in design units, used to scale the simulated subscript relative to the full em box size. This is the numerator of the scaling ratio where denominator is the design units per em. If this member is zero, the font does not specify a scale factor, and the client uses its own policy.</para>
