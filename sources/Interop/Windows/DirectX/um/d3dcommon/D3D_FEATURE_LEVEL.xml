    <summary>
      <para>Allows Microsoft Compute Driver Model (MCDM) devices to be used, or more feature-rich devices (such as traditional GPUs) that support a superset of the functionality. MCDM is the overall driver model for compute-only; it's a scaled-down peer of the larger scoped Windows Device Driver Model (WDDM).</para>
