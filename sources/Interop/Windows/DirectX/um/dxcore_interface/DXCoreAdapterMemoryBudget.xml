    <summary>
      <para>Type: <b>uint64_t</b></para>
      <para>Specifies the OS-provided adapter memory budget, in bytes, that your application should target. If <i>currentUsage</i> is greater than <i>budget</i>, then your application may incur stuttering or performance penalties due to background activity by the OS, which is intended to provide other applications with a fair usage of adapter memory.</para>

      <para>Type: <b>uint64_t</b></para>
      <para>Specifies the amount of adapter memory, in bytes, that your application has available for reservation. To reserve this adapter memory, your application should call <see cref="IDXCoreAdapter.SetState" /> with <i>state</i> set to <see cref="DXCoreAdapterState.AdapterMemoryBudget" />.</para>

    <summary>
      <para>Type: <b>uint64_t</b></para>
      <para>Specifies the amount of adapter memory, in bytes, that is reserved by your application. The OS uses the reservation as a hint to determine your application's minimum working set. Your application should attempt to ensure that its adapter memory usage can be trimmed to meet this requirement.</para>
