      <para>The DDCAPS structure represents the capabilities of the hardware exposed through the DirectDraw object. This structure contains a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com//previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff550292(v=vs.85)">DDSCAPS2</a> structure used in this context to describe what kinds of DirectDrawSurface objects can be created. It might not be possible to create all the surfaces described by these capabilities simultaneously. This structure is used with the <see cref="IDirectDraw7.GetCaps" /> method.</para>
      <para>The Ddraw.h header file contains multiple versions of this structure (for example, DDCAPS_DX7). For more information about how to determine which version to use, see Remarks.</para>

      <para>The overlay can be automatically flipped to the next surface in the flipping chain each time that a video port VSYNC occurs, allowing the video port and the overlay to double-buffer the video without CPU overhead. This option is only valid when the surface is receiving data from a video port. If the video port data is noninterlaced or noninterleaved, it flips on every VSYNC. If the data is being interleaved in memory, it flips on every other VSYNC.</para>

      <h4>DDCAPS2_AUTOFLIPOVERLAY</h4>
      <para>The overlay can be automatically flipped to the next surface in the flipping chain each time that a video port VSYNC occurs, allowing the video port and the overlay to double-buffer the video without CPU overhead. This option is only valid when the surface is receiving data from a video port. If the video port data is noninterlaced or noninterleaved, it flips on every VSYNC. If the data is being interleaved in memory, it flips on every other VSYNC.</para>

To invoke the calibrator when setting new gamma levels, use the DDSGR_CALIBRATE flag when calling the <see cref="IDirectDrawGammaControl.SetGammaRamp" /> method. Calibrating gamma ramps incurs some processing overhead and should not be used frequently.</para>

      <h4>DDCAPS2_STEREO</h4>
      <para>New for DirectX 7.0. Turns on the <b>dwSVCaps</b> bit to support stereo mode. The driver can do stereo in at least one mode other than the current mode.

      <h4>DDCAPS2_TEXMANINNONLOCALVIDMEM</h4>
      <para>New for DirectX 7.0. The Direct3D texture manager uses this capability to decide whether to put managed surfaces in nonlocal video memory.
