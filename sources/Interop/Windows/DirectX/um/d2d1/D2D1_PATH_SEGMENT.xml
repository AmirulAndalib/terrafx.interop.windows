  <member name="D2D1_PATH_SEGMENT.D2D1_PATH_SEGMENT_FORCE_ROUND_LINE_JOIN">
    <summary>
      <para>The segment is always joined with the one preceding it using a round line join, regardless of which <see cref="D2D1_LINE_JOIN" /> enumeration is specified by the <see cref="ID2D1StrokeStyle" /> interface. If this segment is the first segment and the figure is closed, a round line join is used to connect the closing segment with the first segment. If the figure is not closed, this setting has no effect on the first segment of the figure. If <see cref="ID2D1SimplifiedGeometrySink.SetSegmentFlags" /> is called just before <see cref="ID2D1SimplifiedGeometrySink.EndFigure" />, the join between the closing segment and the last explicitly specified segment is affected.</para>
