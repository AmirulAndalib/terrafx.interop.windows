    <summary>
      <para>Represents a cubic bezier segment drawn  between two points.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>A cubic Bezier curve is defined by four points: a start point, an end point (<i>point3</i>), and two control points (<i>point1</i> and <i>point2</i>). A Bezier segment does not contain a property for the starting point of the curve; it defines only the end point. The beginning point of the curve is the current point of the path to which the Bezier curve is added.</para>
      <para>The two control points of a cubic Bezier curve behave like magnets, attracting portions of what would otherwise be a straight line toward themselves and producing a curve. The first control point, <i>point1</i>, affects the beginning portion of the curve; the second control point, <i>point2</i>, affects the ending portion of the curve.</para>
      <para>
        <b>Note</b>  The curve doesn't necessarily pass through either of the control points; each control point moves its portion of the line toward itself, but not through itself.</para>
