  <member name="D2D1_COMBINE_MODE.D2D1_COMBINE_MODE_UNION">
    <summary>
      <para>The two regions are combined by taking the union of both. Given two geometries, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, the resulting geometry is geometry <i>A</i> + geometry <i>B</i>.</para>

  <member name="D2D1_COMBINE_MODE.D2D1_COMBINE_MODE_INTERSECT">
    <summary>
      <para>The two regions are combined by taking their intersection. The new area consists of the overlapping region between the two geometries.</para>

  <member name="D2D1_COMBINE_MODE.D2D1_COMBINE_MODE_XOR">
    <summary>
      <para>The two regions are combined by taking the area that exists in the first region but not the second and the area that exists in the second region but not the first. Given two geometries, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, the new region consists of (<i>A</i>-<i>B</i>) + (<i>B</i>-<i>A</i>).</para>

  <member name="D2D1_COMBINE_MODE.D2D1_COMBINE_MODE_EXCLUDE">
    <summary>
      <para>The second region is excluded from the first. Given two geometries, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, the area of geometry <i>B</i> is removed from the area of geometry <i>A</i>, producing a region that is <i>A</i>-<i>B</i>.</para>
