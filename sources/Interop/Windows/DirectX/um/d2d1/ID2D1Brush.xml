    <summary>Gets the degree of opacity of this brush.</summary>
    <returns>A value between zero and 1 that indicates the opacity of the brush. This value is a constant multiplier that linearly scales the alpha value of all pixels filled by the brush. The opacity values are clamped in the range 0–1 before they are multiplied together.</returns>
