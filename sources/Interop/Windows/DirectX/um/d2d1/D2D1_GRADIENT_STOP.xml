  <member name="D2D1_GRADIENT_STOP">
    <summary>
      <para>Contains the position and color of a gradient stop.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>Gradient stops can be specified in any order if they are at different positions. Two stops may share a position. In this case, the first stop specified is treated as the "low" stop (nearer 0.0f) and subsequent stops are treated as "higher" (nearer 1.0f). This behavior is useful if a caller wants an instant transition in the middle of a stop.</para>
      <para>Typically, there are at least two points in a collection, although creation with only one stop is permitted. For example, one point is at position 0.0f, another point is at position 1.0f, and additional points are distributed in the [0, 1] range. Where the gradient progression is beyond the range of [0, 1], the stops are stored, but may affect the gradient.</para>
      <para>When drawn, the [0, 1] range of positions is mapped to the brush, in a brush-dependent way. For details, see <see cref="ID2D1LinearGradientBrush" /> and <see cref="ID2D1RadialGradientBrush" />.</para>
      <para>Gradient stops with a position outside the [0, 1] range cannot be seen explicitly, but they can still affect the colors produced in the [0, 1] range. For example, a two-stop gradient {{0.0f, Black}, {2.0f, White}} is indistinguishable visually from {{0.0f, Black}, {1.0f, Mid-level gray}}. Also, the colors are clamped before interpolation.</para>

      <para>A value that indicates the relative position of the gradient stop in the brush. This value must be in the [0.0f, 1.0f] range if the gradient stop is to be seen explicitly.</para>
