    <summary>Describes the stroke that outlines a shape.</summary>

  <member name="D2D1_STROKE_STYLE_PROPERTIES.startCap">
    <summary>The cap applied to the start of all the open figures in a stroked geometry.</summary>

    <summary>The cap applied to the end of all the open figures in a stroked geometry.</summary>

  <member name="D2D1_STROKE_STYLE_PROPERTIES.dashCap">
    <summary>The shape at either end of each dash segment.</summary>

  <member name="D2D1_STROKE_STYLE_PROPERTIES.lineJoin">
    <summary>A value that describes how segments are joined. This value is ignored for a vertex if the segment flags specify that the segment should have a smooth join.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D2D1_STROKE_STYLE_PROPERTIES.miterLimit">
    <summary>The limit of the thickness of the join on a mitered corner. This value is always treated as though it is greater than or equal to 1.0f.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D2D1_STROKE_STYLE_PROPERTIES.dashStyle">
    <summary>A value that specifies whether the stroke has a dash pattern and, if so, the dash style.</summary>
  </member>
  <member name="D2D1_STROKE_STYLE_PROPERTIES.dashOffset">
    <summary>A value that specifies an offset in the dash sequence. A positive dash offset value shifts the dash pattern, in units of stroke width, toward the start of the stroked geometry. A negative dash offset value shifts the dash pattern, in units of stroke width, toward the end of the stroked geometry.</summary>
