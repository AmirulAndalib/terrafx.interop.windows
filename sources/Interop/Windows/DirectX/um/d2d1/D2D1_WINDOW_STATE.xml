    <summary>
      <para>Describes whether a window is occluded.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>If the window was occluded the last time  <see cref="EndDraw" /> was called, the next time the render target calls <see cref="CheckWindowState" />, it  returns <b>D2D1_WINDOW_STATE_OCCLUDED</b> regardless of the current window state. If you want to use <b>CheckWindowState</b> to check the current window state, call <b>CheckWindowState</b> after every <b>EndDraw</b> call and ignore its return value. This will ensure that your next call to <b>CheckWindowState</b> state  returns the actual window state.</para>
