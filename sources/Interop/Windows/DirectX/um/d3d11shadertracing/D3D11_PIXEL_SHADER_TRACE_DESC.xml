  <member name="D3D11_PIXEL_SHADER_TRACE_DESC.SampleMask">
    <summary>A value that describes a mask of pixel samples to trace. If this value specifies any of the masked samples, the trace is activated. The least significant bit (LSB) is sample 0. The non-multisample antialiasing (MSAA) counts as a sample count of 1; therefore, the LSB of <b>SampleMask</b> should be set. If set to zero, the pixel is not traced. However, pixel traces can still be enabled on an invocation basis.</summary>
