  <member name="XAUDIO2_FILTER_PARAMETERS.Frequency">
    <summary>Filter radian frequency calculated as (2 * sin(pi * (desired filter cutoff frequency) / sampleRate)). The frequency must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to XAUDIO2_MAX_FILTER_FREQUENCY. The maximum frequency allowable is equal to the source sound's sample rate divided by six which corresponds to the maximum filter radian frequency of 1. For example, if a sound's sample rate is 48000 and the desired cutoff frequency is the maximum allowable value for that sample rate, 8000, the value for <b>Frequency</b> will be 1. If XAUDIO2_HELPER_FUNCTIONS is defined, XAudio2.h will include the <see cref="XAudio2RadiansToCutoffFrequency" /> and <see cref="XAudio2CutoffFrequencyToRadians" /> helper functions for converting between hertz and radian frequencies. Defining XAUDIO2_HELPER_FUNCTIONS will also include <see cref="XAudio2CutoffFrequencyToOnePoleCoefficient" /> for converting between hertz and a one-pole coefficient suitable for use with the LowPassOnePoleFilter and HighPassOnePoleFilter.</summary>

  <member name="XAUDIO2_FILTER_PARAMETERS.OneOverQ">
    <summary>Reciprocal of Q factor. Controls how quickly frequencies beyond Frequency are dampened. Larger values result in quicker dampening while smaller values cause dampening to occur more gradually. Must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to XAUDIO2_MAX_FILTER_ONEOVERQ.</summary>
