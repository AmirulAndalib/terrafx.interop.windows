      <para>A mastering voice is used to represent the audio output device.</para>
      <para>Data buffers cannot be submitted directly to mastering voices, but data submitted to other types of voices must be directed to a mastering voice to be heard.</para>
      <para>
        <b>IXAudio2MasteringVoice</b> inherits directly from <see cref="IXAudio2Voice" />, but does not implement methods specific to mastering voices. The interface type exists solely because some of the base class methods are implemented differently for mastering voices. Having a separate type for these voices helps client code to distinguish the different voice types and to benefit from C++ type safety.</para>
