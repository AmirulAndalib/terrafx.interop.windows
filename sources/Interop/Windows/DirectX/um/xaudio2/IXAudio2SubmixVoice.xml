    <summary>
      <para>A submix voice is used primarily for performance improvements and effects processing.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>Data buffers cannot be submitted directly to submix voices and will not be audible unless submitted to a mastering voice. A submix voice can be used to ensure that a particular set of voice data is converted to the same format and/or to have a particular effect chain processed on the collective result.</para>
      <para>IXAudio2SubmixVoice inherits directly from <see cref="IXAudio2Voice" />, but does not implement methods specific to submix voices. The interface type exists solely because some of the base class methods are implemented differently for submix voices. Having a separate type for these voices helps client code to distinguish the different voice types and to benefit from C++ type safety.</para>
      <h3>Platform Requirements</h3>
      <para>Windows 10 (XAudio2.9); Windows 8, Windows Phone 8 (XAudio 2.8); DirectX SDK (XAudio 2.7)</para>
