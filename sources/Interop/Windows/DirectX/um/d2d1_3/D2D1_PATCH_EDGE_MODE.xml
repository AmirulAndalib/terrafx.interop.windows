  <member name="D2D1_PATCH_EDGE_MODE.D2D1_PATCH_EDGE_MODE_ALIASED_INFLATED">
    <summary>Render this patch edge aliased and also slightly inflated. Use this for the internal edges of your gradient mesh when there could be t-junctions among patches. Inflating the internal edges mitigates seams that can appear along those junctions.</summary>
