  <member name="ID2D1SpriteBatch.AddSprites">
    <summary>Adds the given sprites to the end of this sprite batch.</summary>
    <param name="spriteCount">The number of sprites to be added. This determines how many strides into each given array Direct2D will read.</param>
    <param name="destinationRectangles">A pointer to an array containing the destination rectangles specifying where to draw the sprites on the destination device context.</param>
    <param name="sourceRectangles">A pointer to an array containing the source rectangles specifying the regions of the source bitmap to draw as sprites. Direct2D will use the entire source bitmap for sprites that are assigned a null value or the InfiniteRectU. If this parameter is omitted entirely or set to a null value, then Direct2D will use the entire source bitmap for all the added sprites.</param>
    <param name="colors">
      <para>A pointer to an array containing the colors to apply to each sprite. The output color is the result of component-wise multiplication of the source bitmap color and the provided color. The output color is not clamped.</para>
      <para>Direct2D will not change the color of sprites that are assigned a null value. If this parameter is omitted entirely or set to a null value, then Direct2D will not change the color of any of the added sprites.</para>

    </param>
    <param name="destinationRectanglesStride">Specifies the distance, in bytes, between each rectangle in the destinationRectangles array. If you provide a stride of 0, then the same destination rectangle will be used for each added sprite.</param>
    <param name="sourceRectanglesStride">Specifies the distance, in bytes, between each rectangle in the sourceRectangles array (if that array is given). If you provide a stride of 0, then the same source rectangle will be used for each added sprite.</param>
    <param name="colorsStride">Specifies the distance, in bytes, between each color in the colors array (if that array is given). If you provide a stride of 0, then the same color will be used for each added sprite.</param>
