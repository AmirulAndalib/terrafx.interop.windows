    <summary>
      <para>Controls option flags for a new ID2D1ImageSource when it is created.</para>
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>D2D1_IMAGE_SOURCE_CREATION_OPTIONS_RELEASE_SOURCE causes the image source to not retain a reference to the source object used to create it.
It can decrease the quality and efficiency of printing.</para>

  <member name="D2D1_IMAGE_SOURCE_LOADING_OPTIONS.D2D1_IMAGE_SOURCE_LOADING_OPTIONS_RELEASE_SOURCE">
    <summary>
      <para>Indicates the image source should release its reference to the WIC bitmap source after it has initialized.
By default, the image source retains a reference to the WIC bitmap source for the lifetime of the object to enable quality and speed optimizations for printing.
This option disables that optimization.</para>

  <member name="D2D1_IMAGE_SOURCE_LOADING_OPTIONS.D2D1_IMAGE_SOURCE_LOADING_OPTIONS_CACHE_ON_DEMAND">
    <summary>
      <para>Indicates the image source should only populate subregions of the image cache on-demand. You can control this behavior using
the <see cref="EnsureCached" /></para>
      <para>and <see cref="TrimCache" /> methods.
This options provides the ability to improve memory usage by only keeping needed portions of the image in memory.
This option requires that the image source has a reference to the WIC bitmap source, and is incompatible with D2D1_IMAGE_SOURCE_LOADING_OPTIONS_RELEASE_SOURCE.</para>
