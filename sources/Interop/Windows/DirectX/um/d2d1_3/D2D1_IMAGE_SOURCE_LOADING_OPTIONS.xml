  <member name="D2D1_IMAGE_SOURCE_LOADING_OPTIONS.D2D1_IMAGE_SOURCE_LOADING_OPTIONS_RELEASE_SOURCE">
    <summary>Indicates the image source should release its reference to the WIC bitmap source after it has initialized. By default, the image source retains a reference to the WIC bitmap source for the lifetime of the object to enable quality and speed optimizations for printing. This option disables that optimization.</summary>

  <member name="D2D1_IMAGE_SOURCE_LOADING_OPTIONS.D2D1_IMAGE_SOURCE_LOADING_OPTIONS_CACHE_ON_DEMAND">
    <summary>Indicates the image source should only populate subregions of the image cache on-demand. You can control this behavior using the <see cref="EnsureCached" />and <see cref="TrimCache" /> methods. This options provides the ability to improve memory usage by only keeping needed portions of the image in memory. This option requires that the image source has a reference to the WIC bitmap source, and is incompatible with D2D1_IMAGE_SOURCE_LOADING_OPTIONS_RELEASE_SOURCE.</summary>
