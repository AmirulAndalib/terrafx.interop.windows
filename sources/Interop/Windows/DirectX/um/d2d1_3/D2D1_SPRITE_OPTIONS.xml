    <summary>Specifies additional aspects of how a sprite batch is to be drawn, as part of a call to <see cref="ID2D1DeviceContext3.DrawSpriteBatch" />.</summary>

    <summary>Default value. No special drawing configuration. This option yields the best drawing performance.</summary>

  <member name="D2D1_SPRITE_OPTIONS.D2D1_SPRITE_OPTIONS_CLAMP_TO_SOURCE_RECTANGLE">
    <summary>Interpolation of bitmap pixels will be clamped to the sprite’s source rectangle. If the sub-images in your source bitmap have no pixels separating them, then you may see color bleeding when drawing them with D2D1_SPRITE_OPTIONS_NONE. In that case, consider adding borders between them with your sprite-packing tool, or use this option. Note that drawing sprites with this option enabled is slower than using D2D1_SPRITE_OPTIONS_NONE.</summary>
