  <member name="ID2D1DeviceContext3.CreateSpriteBatch">
    <summary>Creates a new, empty sprite batch. After creating a sprite batch, use <see cref="ID2D1SpriteBatch.AddSprites" />to add sprites to it, then use <see cref="ID2D1DeviceContext3.DrawSpriteBatch" /> to draw it.</summary>
    <param name="spriteBatch">When this method returns, contains a pointer to a new, empty sprite batch to be populated by the app.</param>
    <returns>If this method succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.</returns>

    <summary>Renders all sprites in the given sprite batch to the device context using the specified drawing options.</summary>

    <param name="bitmap">The bitmap from which the sprites are to be sourced. Each sprite’s source rectangle refers to a portion of this bitmap.</param>
